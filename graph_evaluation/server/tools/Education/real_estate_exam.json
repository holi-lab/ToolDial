Ulyanna's parcel is situated upstream from Daniel's parcel. Over time, the action of the river's water has moved some silt and dirt from the shores of Ursula's property and deposited it downstream on the shores of Daniel's property. Based upon this fact pattern, which of the following lists best describes what has occurred on Daniel's property?",
                        "tags":"Freehold Estates",
                        "feedback":"This series of words best describes what has happened on Daniel's property. As it pertains to real estate, \"accession\" means to acquire more land, even a small amount of land. \"Accretion\" is accession that occurs through natural causes. Here, what happened on Daniel's land is accession by accretion because the natural action of the river's water deposited silt on the shores of Daniel's property. Finally, \"alluvium\" is a technical term for the silt/dirt moved by the river from Ulyanna's shores and deposited on Daniel's shores.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. \"Alienation\" means to separate real estate from its owner. Alienation can occur either through voluntary means (e.g., sale, gift, dedication, etc.) or involuntary means (e.g., foreclosure, tax sale, adverse possession, etc.). Here, Daniel is acquiring property, not losing it. Answer Choice \"A\" is also incorrect because of the word \"attachment.\" While attachment is property gained through accession, attachment is created through human intervention. For example, if a tenant had rented Daniel's property, constructed a shed on it, and then left the shed after the lease was over, that would have been an example of accession by attachment. Here, Daniel is gaining additional property through the natural action of the river's water (i.e., accretion). B is incorrect. Littoral has to do with rights of owners who live by standing water, like a lake, a pond, or the ocean. There is nothing in the fact pattern to suggest either parcel of property is near a body of standing water. C is incorrect. These terms are used by appraisers to describe the increase in value when an owner combines several contiguous or touching parcels into one large parcel. The act of combining several parcels into one parcel is called \"assemblage.\" The increase in value that should result from the consolidation is called \"plottage.\" (e.g., five separate parcels each have a value of $100,000 totaling $500,000. After assembling them together into one large parcel, the value of the one large parcel is $525,000. The additional $25,000 is plottage.)",

Her nephew is the remainderman. The life tenant wants to take out a loan using the property as collateral. Which of the following statements is correct?",
                        "tags":"Ownership",
                        "feedback":"The life tenant (i.e., the aunt) can take out a loan on the property without the remainderman's signature. However, if only the life tenant life signs the loan documents, then the debt will die with her. In order to protect the lender's security interest in the event of the aunt's death, both the life tenant and the remainderman will need to sign the loan documents. The same would be true if the property were being sold: Both the life tenant and the remainderman would need to sign the deed in order to ensure that the buyer's ownership interest in the property would continue after the life tenant dies.\r\n\r\nTest-Taking Tip: Remember a life estate is an estate of ownership (aka a \"freehold\" estate). With a life estate, there is a \"present interest\" and a \"future interest.\" A simple way to figure out who owns each interest is to ask yourself the following two questions: \"Who has the right to possess the property in the present?\" Here, the aunt does: She holds a present interest in the property, and, because she is the measuring life, she will hold that interest until she dies. \"Who will have the right to possess the property in the future?\" Here, the nephew does: He holds a future interest in the property.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Provided that both the life tenant and the remainderman sign the loan documents, the lender's security interest in the real estate will be protected if the life tenant dies during the term of the loan. B is incorrect. If the remainderman does not sign the loan documents, the lender's security interest in the real estate will terminate upon the death of the life tenant. C is incorrect. A nonfreehold estate is a leasehold estate. A life estate, by contrast, is a freehold estate (i.e., an estate of ownership).",

The owner can be, for example, an individual, a corporation, a governmental entity, a trust, or a partnership. As long as it is sole ownership, it is an ownership in severalty (aka \"an estate in severalty\"). Test-Taking Tip: This is frequently tested because of the word \"several\" in \"severalty.\"\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Concurrent ownership occurs when there are multiple owners of the same parcel of real estate holding title together at the same time. C is incorrect. If there are multiple owners (e.g., one owner owns 90%, a second owner owns 9%, and the third owner owns 1%), ownership is described as \"fractional, but undivided.\" This means that--no matter how small their ownership interest is--each owner has an equal right of possession as to the entire parcel of land. D is incorrect. If two owners hold title with a right of survivorship, and one owner dies, then the survivor acquires the decedent's interest in the property automatically, through operation of law. Depending on the state, common ways to hold title with a right of survivorship include: tenancy by the entirety, joint tenancy, and/or community property with right of survivorship.",

Here, the parcel that benefits from the easement is Parcel North because the easement allows the owner to cross over the westerly 8 feet of Parcel South to get access to the road. Parcel South is burdened with the easement because people who don't even own the land are allowed to use the westerly 8 feet of Parcel South for ingress and egress purposes. The owner of a parcel of real estate burdened with a servient tenement cannot unilaterally terminate an easement appurtenant. An easement appurtenant \"runs with the land\" and transfers with the deed. Therefore, by fencing in Parcel South, the new owner of Parcel South will most likely be found to have violated the easement conditions and will lose the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. An easement in gross only has one parcel of land (a servient tenement). The classic example of an easement in gross is a public utilities easement. The public utility does not need to own a contiguous parcel in order to have an easement in gross. This test question states that there are two parcels of land, a dominant and a servient tenement. Therefore, this fact pattern does not describe an easement in gross. C is incorrect. A landlocked property is one without access to a street or road. An easement by necessity is created by the courts when a property is landlocked--provided that the owner of the landlocked parcel did not create the problem. Here, when the old owner split the large parcel into two, the old owner carefully reserved an easement over Parcel South, preventing Parcel North from becoming landlocked. Because the old owner reserved an easement in the deed, there was no need to go to court and ask for an easement by necessity. D is incorrect. This answer choice states the general rule, but the owner of Parcel South purchased the property subject to the easement. Because easements appurtenant run with the land, the easement is binding on the new owner of Parcel South.\r\nTest-Taking Tip: Pay close attention when you see answer choices that are almost identical like \"A\" and \"B.\" Frequently, when two choices are so close, this is what the examiners are testing.",

This power is called eminent domain. Taking private property to widen a highway is a classic example of when the government (e.g., city, county, state, or federal) would exercise its power of eminent domain. However, the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does state that government entities exercising this power must pay the private property owners just or fair compensation.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Condemnation is the name for the legal proceeding to determine what just or fair compensation is for each parcel of real estate taken by the government. It is not the name of the government power itself. B is incorrect. The government's police power is the right of the government to establish and enact laws to promote public health, public safety, public welfare, and morals. Two classic examples of police power are zoning and building codes. Test-Taking Tip: When the government exercises its police powers, typically no compensation need be paid to affected property owners. D is incorrect. In our legal system, real estate must be owned by someone. In England, if the owner abandoned a parcel of real estate or died without a will (i.e., intestate) and without heirs, the property \"reverted\" back to the original owner, the Crown. In the United States, this parcel of real estate would revert back to the state. This governmental power is called \"escheat.\"\r\n\r\nTest-Taking Tip: In addition to police power, eminent domain, and escheat, the government also has the power to tax real estate. Your memory aid for these four governmental powers over land is PETE: Police Power, Eminent Domain, Taxation, and Escheat. These are four separate powers.

Test-Taking Tip: Because it is frequently tested, it is worth reviewing the other promises, agreements, and contracts that must be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

In contrast, the special agent acting under the authority of the exclusive right-to-sell listing agreement typically only has the sole duty of finding a buyer. Special agency is an advisory position, and the agent traditionally lacks the authority to bind the principal (e.g., a listing agent can solicit offers, but lacks the power to accept an offer and bind the seller).

Lessee immediately called--and spoke to--Lessor to report the problem. Lessor promised to have the heater fixed, but was vague about when the repair would occur. Lessee followed up with multiple phone calls, texts, and emails. After several days without heat, Lessee abandoned the residential rental unit, and subsequently refused to pay rent for the remaining term of the lease. Lessor sued Lessee for the unpaid rent. Who will most likely win the lawsuit?",
