                    "review":"I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboardis about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.Multi-tasking / browsing / usageSome sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go.

                    "review":"The good: very speedy, silent, the midnight color is beautiful (more like a dark gray).The bad or not great:The display is just odd, I can't stand the ugly notch, it's a distraction and doesn't even offer Face ID! Windows laptops have had that for many years now, without a big ugly cut out that feels like it is spying on you with no manual privacy lid (like ThinkPads have for example). Also it is too glossy and reflective, would much prefer a matte anti-glare screen option. The display resolution quality is great, but not as great as the 14\" MacBook Pro.The keyboard is OK but shallower than the 14\" MacBook Pro. It feels like I am bottoming out when typing with my natural amount of pressure.The speakers/sound are also just OK. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro's speakers which have a better system like up/front speakers, this one sounds like they are only coming from the bottom of the laptop.The weight is a little heavier than I thought. Honestly it is a negligible difference between the MacBook Pro and Air.I will wait for the 14\" MacBook Pro with the M2 chip and Midnight color.",

I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.",

USB 4 is Thunderbolt.. if you like Apple and need  new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..",

Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.",

The screen opens very smoothly, which is a nice change from the 2020s somewhat stiff lid pull. I love how this feels in your hands. The flat surface makes it easier to grip. The black finish looks incredible. I thought it was going to be a darker gray finish but no, it’s jet black, and it looks magnificent.All in all this is a huge upgrade from the 2020 MacBook Air. Highly recommend.",

I'm not an Apple Fanboy, but have to give Apple side props for making a computer that was functional for 10 years.Getting behind the new M2 Air has been so satisfying. Incredibly snappy, and I've been working on the same charge for several days! Also, I love the new Midnight color.My wife has the previous M1 Air, which is similarly snappy. Honestly, the only reason I held out (and paid a few hundred more) was for the Magsafe charging. (We have a puppy and a baby, and one of the two will be tugging on cords).Overall, very happy with the purchase. Seems like the nice quality that people expect out of Apple.",
