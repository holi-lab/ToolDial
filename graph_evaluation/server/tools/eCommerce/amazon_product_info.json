Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I'm done with it. I've had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.",

Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn't quite compare to my old phone's Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn't. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I'm definitely returning it. Also didn't come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright.

He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.My advice, don't waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn't mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it's sad that Samsung can't make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I've never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won't make that mistake again.Update:I made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues.

Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I'm done with it. I've had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.",

                        "review":"The cameras, the S-pen, the AMOLED screen quality, the 120 Hz refresh rate, the 5G data connection, the build quality, etc. are all top notch. This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone.Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you're somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.",
