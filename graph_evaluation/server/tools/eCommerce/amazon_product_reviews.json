For the price ($25), this is a pretty good headset. The game sound is decent, and the fit on my head is pretty comfy. Some downsides I have seen are, I could barely hear my friends during game play. I've been messing with the audio settings, but I haven't figured it out yet. Maybe that is just the headset. I can hear them, but not at the volume I'd like. Also, the cord is ridiculously long. I'm sure that is for PC players, but it's annoyingly bunched up for a console controller.",

The cups on the ears are not as big as I expected.  So, if you want something that will fit over the ears this is not the set for you.  But otherwise, they are comfortable.  The noise cancellation is excellent.  The look is sleek, and I like it.  The headphones are easy to setup but be sure to plug in the adapter if you are using it with PC.",

There is a small piece inside the right side that has come off that can rattle around, but only when you shake it do you hear it.  Can be used to listen to music but the sound quality is only ok at best.  I'm not an audiophile but there is a big difference between a set of these and a $150 turtle beach set.  As far as comfort, the ear pieces don't go over my entire ear, but rather sit on it.  Normally this would be a problem but the headset allows you to bend it slightly so they don't squeeze.  Or if they are too loose you can bend them in to get them tighter.  If all you want is a reasonably comfortable headset for gaming and the the occasional music, these are great for the price point.",
