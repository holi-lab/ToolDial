Oculus provide air link to your PC(still beta version),  so IT WORKS on YOUR STEAM ! But it may disconnect occasionally.Things I DON’T LIKE :(1), it takes time to wear because I have a glasses. So I need to put VR on, adjust my glass to a comfortable position until I can see clearly. My current glasses has large frame, which doesnt fit into the VR, so I have to use my old glass that has smaller frame to fit, which still make me feel super tight when I put VR on.(2), All in one device means the processor will generate heat. I don't think this device has cooling system. So if you play the game for a while, your head will feel hot and sweat.Overall, I still recommend it.",

                        "review":"I think Facebook did a great thing with this \"new\" release of the quest 2. The headset itself feels quite nice, although the strap is definitely something to work on, it's way too front heavy. It's also extremely uncomfortable using glasses, unfortunately. Even with that said, the Oculus link feature was the only reason I bought this headset; and it's everything I could of asked for. My internet isn't even that good, all it needed was my laptop to be connected by ethernet for a smooth, high quality PCVR experience that I could take ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE! I only had slight lags and stutters, but that's likely just my mediocre hardware. I'm a bit bummed by the comparably smaller control scheme compared to something like the vive.If you really want to have the best experience with this headset though, then don't put away that wallet just yet. At the very least, a new strap would be optimal, and I'd stay away from the first party elite strap. A new face cover might be good for you as well, as the default foam cover isn't the best for everyone.Overall, this headset is a great step in the right direction for vr tech. Although, out of the box, it should be subject to some modifications; which some could call a feature.One more thing, don't worry about the whole Facebook account thing. If you're fine with using whatsapp or Instagram, this shouldn't be a problem either. It's not like Facebook with Oculus is a new thing either, as Facebook has owned Oculus for 7 years now.Edit: after about a month of use, this headset has now become the most annoying piece of tech I own. The one feature I bought this for (Airlink) is straight garbage over half the time, im spending more time trying to fix this failure than I am actually using it. Connection hilariously unstable over ethernet with completely random performance drops. So both an unstable and sometimes unplayable experience that I paid 300 dollars for.",

But, in terms of value, there is absolutely nothing better on the market than this headset.Even the previous 64GB iteration (for the same price) was still great value, so this updated version (which also addresses the facial irritations caused by the old face pads) is a no brainer. If you have even a HINT of curiosity about getting into the VR world, this is THE headset to get! You won't be disappointed!(Side Note: The \"mandatory\" Facebook integration, while a negative to some, is actually a good quality \"appstore\" interface, that's quite easy to log into and use with your existing Facebook account. Any digital storefront in the world requires some sort of \"account,\" but letting me use my own Facebook actually simplifies the process even further.)",

Truly a crazy experience to be in a virtual world--you actually forget that what you see isn't actually real. I found myself oftentimes carefully not bumping into the i.e. furniture in the virtual world when it was just space and nothingness outside of it. One of the coolest features I am stumped about is that if you leave a certain area that you have previously marked, the headset has a grayscale camera that reveals what's in front of you. This is extremely useful for safety measures as it alerts you if you stray too far from your marked territory. Absolutely love it! Also, the headset lasts for about ~2 hours before you need to recharge if you're playing games nonstop.Edit: For those who wear glasses, I highly recommend to buy VR Wave prescription lenses with the headset. For me personally, it's been huge inconvenience trying to remove the headset and putting it back on until I made the investment and bought the lenses. It'll definitely help with having fun in VR without having to adjust your headset frequently.",

I was looking forward to playing my favorite games, such as Space Engine, Half-Life Alyx, Pavlov, etc, in a wireless package.Unfortunately, zuckerberg and his minions don't want you to have fun and be happy. They want you to only buy approved, selected, overpriced \"games\" from their Oculus app store. The least they could do is let me have google earth, like with my last Oculus, but no, not even that is available. It would be really great if we could simply install the VR games we want onto this standalone device from our Steam library, but facebook doesn't want you to independently choose what you do with the Oculus Quest 2, they want a monopoly (what the f*** is the 256GB for then??). There is no option for open-source gaming unless you plug the headset into your PC (so why the f*** did I bother buying a headset that is advertised as \"wireless\" and \"without limits?\").I don't know if the relevant powers that be will actually see this review, but just in case, I kindly ask the Lizard Clan to unf*** this device that is, as of now, a waste of money. After seeing the latest testimony from the facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, asserting that facebook doesn't care about their users, I have very little confidence that they will give any consideration to complaints such as mine.Facebook has ruined Oculus, just like Disney has ruined Star Wars. Save your money for a Valve Index instead. Also I hate the antichrist.",
