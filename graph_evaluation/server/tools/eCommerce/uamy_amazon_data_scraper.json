The Apple Pencil 2 is a definite upgrade to the Apple Pencil 1 almost just because you can charge the pencil by attaching it to your IPad. This feature alone makes the Apple Pencil worth buying. The Apple Pencil 2 also has no lag and write flawlessly. It is very comfortable to hold. The only downside is the pencil is a bit expensive but that’s common for most Apple products. Overall, I would recommend the Apple Pencil 2 if you have a new version of the IPad Pro.",

The Apple Pencil 2 is a definite upgrade to the Apple Pencil 1 almost just because you can charge the pencil by attaching it to your IPad. This feature alone makes the Apple Pencil worth buying. The Apple Pencil 2 also has no lag and write flawlessly. It is very comfortable to hold. The only downside is the pencil is a bit expensive but that’s common for most Apple products. Overall, I would recommend the Apple Pencil 2 if you have a new version of the IPad Pro.",

Charging and connecting is so super easy now. The pencil reacts super well for drawing, sketching, drafting and to me as an interior architect especially well with autoCAD, morpholio and other drawing apps. The tab on the pen to bring the eraser to front makes my workflow so much more enjoyable. Although it doesn't seem like much that Apple has added one flat side to the overall round pencil design it makes such a huge difference in holding comfort. The fact that it attaches magnetically to the side of my iPad pro is super helpful as I don't have to look for the pencil any more. It is right were it belongs to be while not being in the way. Absolute buying recommendation if you are a heavy graphics designer or even just a casual user. It is also just a whole lot of fun to interact with the pencil on the iPad!",

No big deal, there's a one year warranty.  However, Apple informed me that the warranty on my pencil's serial number expired already.  The Apple warranty department is reviewing this as I was able to produce an Amazon receipt showing that Amazon sold this to me as \"new\", but they told me this was not the first time they've seen this.  I think for me, this is the final straw with Amazon, coupled with reports of them banning books based on political viewpoints, I'm done giving Amazon my Prime money.  As for the pencil, it makes using the iPad easier, but shame on Apple for milking $130 from people for something that should cost no more than $50.  Incidentally, we checked the serial number on the iPad.  At least Amazon got that right.",

After trying for an hour to get this to connect to her IPad via Bluetooth my daughter called Apple.  The first phone call she was told to connect the pencil to the right side of her IPad via the magnetic connection and to let it fully charge before trying to connect it to the IPad via Bluetooth.  She was told that during the charging process that the pencil and IPad would connect via Bluetooth automatically.  After letting the pencil fully charge my daughter found out that they still would not connect to each other.  That's when she called Apple the second time.  This time she was told that the Apple Pencil 2 will only work with the IPad Pro, not the IPad generation 7, even though it was a new model.  She was told that she would have to return the Apple Pencil 2 and order the older version Apple Pencil 1 in order for it to work with her IPad.  Nowhere in the description on Amazon's website does it explain this.  Make sure you go to Apple's website to find out which pencil will work with your IPad BEFORE ordering one.",

                        "review":"Finally splurged for this pencil after using soft tipped, non-accurate stylus’s for years. Below is my feedback. Note that I have an iPad Pro 3rd generation tablet.- accuracy is excellent. Regular cheap stylus’s are difficult to select particular letters of words, and they aren’t good at copying and pasting. Apple Pencil does this extremely well!- controlling YouTube fast forward or back is so much easier using this pencil vs my fat finger.- pencil feels so comfortable in your hand. To me, the perfect diameter.- pencil length is also great as it allows me to reach everywhere on my iPad screen.- the tip of the pencil is pointy but smooth. Won’t damage your screen if you don’t have a glass protective cover. And, the thinness of the tip fits perfectly between letters when you want to make a selection.-  battery lasts a very long time.-  recharging the pencil by magnetically attaching to the top of your iPad makes the process so easy!- you will not be able to swipe up using the pencil to bring up open apps nor can you access control center from the upper right hand corner. I can live with this but I hope a software update in the future addresses this.- now the major flaw! You can’t use this pencil on your iPhone. I have an 11 pro max and it’s so disappointing that Apple didn’t make the pencil work on iPhone. For the cost of this item I find that to be unacceptable! Apple, if you are reading these reviews make the next generation pencil work with iPhone!!!However, I still highly recommend this item for use with your iPad.",
