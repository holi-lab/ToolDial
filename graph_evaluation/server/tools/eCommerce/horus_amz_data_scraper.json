I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.  I wanted to share that, as I found the Q&A to be a little confusing on that point and other reviews didn't really mention it.",

Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time.",

Also the screen seemed loose.  So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen.  Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no.  I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks.",

We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional.
