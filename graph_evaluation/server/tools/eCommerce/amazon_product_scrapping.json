The straps are honestly too short to allow for any meaningful adjustment if you have a short to normal torso. So, I exchanged it for a small size to see if that would help.When the exchange came in:The leg length was perfect. The torso had not changed AT ALL, despite the fact that I taken the waist measurement down TWO sizes. The strap, (as shown in the pictures) was broken which also meant it wouldn’t stay on. The straps are sewn in a way that you can’t undo it to fix yourself without tearing it up.Overall:If you have a long torso congrats you’ll be fine otherwise look elsewhere, and if you exchange it be ready to receive a broken replacement. The material was really nice though, which just made me more disappointed that the fit was poor.",

                        "review":"I bought these for the price to supplement a pair of Carhart of the same design, color , etc but actually  prefer the  pockets on this pair . Other than that they are so similar , down to the waist being a little snug against my big belly . I will say the crotch is slightly more generous to my family jewels when I'm sitting but still not as friendly as a pair of sweat pants . The screwdriver pockets on the sides being straight across helps tremendously with snagging on roller system sides vs the slanted on my Carharts . The hand pockets on my Carharts feel like they are just wrong , like hands warmer pockets that are useless for anything else . Not so with these . I can put my car keys in my  pocket, sit down and they don't poke me in the stomach with the Amazon Essentials . If the hammer holder on the left side gets caught on the rollers I mentioned before , that's an easy fix , especially since I won't be hanging anything from it .The clasps on both are the same design but the AE ones work so much easier , as if the slot is a little wider and bend a little less angled . I also prefer the dull brass to the nickel color of the Carharts .I doubt I'll be zipping either pair up the legs so the difference between lengths (knee vs upper thigh ) is not something I'll like or dislike . All other zippers seem apples to apples . The insulation seems spot on the same to me but time will tell if one works here than the other .Both are 30\" inseam and are about 1/2\" too long . Amazon offers a 29\" (or other specific length ) in every waist size whereas Carhart offers nothing shorter than 30\" , no matter the waist size . Finding a 40x30 reminded me of when I was a kid and jeans were available in a plethora of size combos , no matter the brand or size .If I were to get another pair of these and was not on my way down in weight and belly girth I'd suggest others with a \"barrel chest\" go 2 sizes up from their normal relaxed fit pants size .If they had an elastic area at the waist ,like Walls and Carhart do , they'd be a 5+ but not having that makes it more difficult to be comfortable when I'm layered more than 2 shirts underneath .Edit . I bought another pair in a larger waist size and they are night/day more comfortable on my belly . I also have spilled coffee on them and it soaked through like a sponge when it gets saturated so these are definitely NOT water repellent like Carhart and Walls . Maybe Scotchgard , or some other product , may help with that but these are not something I'll be wearing in the snow  .",

                        "review":"Can't compare these lined bib overalls to Carhartt because they're not Carhartt. But, they are quality made, comfortable fit, and solid build for an amazing price. This is what Amazon Basics / Amazon Essentials should be doing... making our basic needs easier to purchase, more affordable, and simpler take advantage of for everyday life.The fit for me was spot on for what I expected. I wear my jeans slightly on the tight-side. I order Wrangler jeans at 36W and these overalls give me a little room over how I normally wear my jeans. I order jeans at 32 inseam (length) and these give me a little additional length and cover boot top while seated. That's a great fit for overalls. So, for me, I ordered what I wear every day and they fit good. --- If you want room for more clothing underneath then order accordingly.If your belly overhangs your waist, remember these are overalls and the belly size of the overalls is the same measurement as the waist... your true waist is at your navel. Might be worth measuring before ordering. Cheers!",

Decently warm but not too much since it's the pant part only that is insulated.The right leg pocket is not so useful as a utility knife pocket as it's more cell phone size that quick knife. Some of you know what I'm talking about. Good for a pair of large vise grips or channel locks but you have to dig for a knife or screwdriver.The strap clasps/hooks are not as annoying as the new Carhart ones (that are terrible) but still not as good as the button style that worked for a hundred years.",
