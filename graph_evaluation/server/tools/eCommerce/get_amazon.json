                    "review":"So first of i apologize for this long read, but if youre here to contemplate buying a cheap vizeo or and even more exoensive higher end tv like I was, then i hope this can give u some persoective in making your decision, if you've done any shopping around for samaung tvs, you know that this is more of the entry way into the nicer samsung displays. With that being said, after having it for a few months, streaming, casting, listening to music,  and playing ps4 and switch. I must say, it's an incredible TV. I chose to go samsung as I've always been a samsung fan, but also because even though you can get a much cheaper large display 4k vizio/tlc/hisence. The problem with those, as I've experienced in the past is that they highly cheapest on the processor as the user interface is frustrating slow. Apps fail to load, Netflix finally starts up by the time your nexfl8x and xhill girl needs to go home, internet connection is crap, pixels die in a few months if they didnt already arrive dead, tv freezes as youre trying to put on your favorite streaming app and videos consistently buffer, and the color accurancy is ok at best, and it's a shot in the dark whether or not you're going to recieve a bad apple that will break down in a few months. What I love about this TV is that everything seems quite snappy and quick. Setup was simple through the samsung smart things phone app. Internet seems fast, you can use your phone as a keyboard and remote through the smart things app as well as lunch apps and project your phone and pc screen wirelessly. The picture quality is great even though it's using the lite Quantum upscale 4k processor unlike the bigger bothers of the line, however even when watching a 1080p movie, the upscaling does seem to make it much more detailed and higj res. The TV seems smart enough to always know what input I want it in as I turn on different entertainment systems. The user interface in my opinion is pretty straight forward, and you get free access to samsung tv + which provides a whole bunch of free channels, and for someone who hasn't had cable TV in the last decade or so, it's a nice touch. You also get access to all the typical smart TV apps like Netflix, Disney, hulu, prime, funimation, HBO, youtube, crackle, tubi, apple tv, plex, pandora, AMC, spotify, news apps and a browser and a bunchnof others ive yet to install. But bear in mind this is not a full fledged android tv, so apps are plentiful but limited for sure. However I'm surprised that even with the inclusion of Google assistant, I'm unable to cast whatever I want to the TV, besides YouTube and Netflix and other apps that are already included with casting capabilities on the tv, so I had to get a chrome cast to cast my own things.... or maybe im just dumb and iverlooked something. One cool thing though is if u have an android (not sure about iphone), you can control almost everything from the smart things app and project your phone onto the screen and even have multiple things on the screen at a time including your ohine screen as you watch netflix to the other side. For ios users apple airplay is built in. And the integrated alexa/Google assistant/smartthings can be used to control any smart devices u have in your home - smartt lights, robot vaccums, nest thermostats, smart switches and all other alexa/google assistant stuff which is great. As well as getting your phone notifications to show on the tv. And if u have other smart speakers, those can be used control the tv as well.Now unfortunately  for some of the bad. First of all is it's not as pixel clear and bright as it's more expensive order brothers. The viewing radius is good but not great, But by setting the display to dynamic or vivid and the brightness slightly up, it's honestly plenty bright and colorful and clear for me. Second is the built in speakers are okay.... I mean they're not horrible, and can definitely be enjoyable in a smaller area, but there's next to no bass, and voices are a little more pitchy than they should be, so a decent sound bar with a sub will go a long way. Personally i got the samsung HW-650 with DTS virtual x and the included sub woofer for not that much money and it basically as close to a home movie theatre experience now.  My least favorite things though is that it only has 3 hdmi inputs, 1 of which is an hdmi eARC port that I use for my sound bar, which leaves me with just 2 hdmi ports. Perhaps thats more than enough for you, but with a few gaming systems and a sound bar ive already ran through all of them, however you can find high quality cheap hdmi port splitters right here on Amazon so no big deal but still, and luckily my Samsung soundbar has an extra hdmi port that can be accessed through the TV. My last and final gripe I should say is the remote. At first I actually really liked how small and simple and compact it is, it even can charge through solar or USB c. But overtime youll realize that sometimes having more buttons is better as you just end up having to click more buttons to get things done, like changing the input source, opening the settings, finding your apps, and typing in channel numbers. though the alexa/Google assistant functionality does fill in some gaps for sure.Overall I'm thrilled I went with this model despite being able to afford the higher end ones. Sure go for it if you wish, but i would say this will surely suffice you, and you might save enough money to get an even larger tv or better sound system, maybe even a second tv for your room or something.Last thing, I saw some comments about the refresh rate of this tv being just 60hz, however according to the official samsung listing of this exact model, it should be 120hz. I've yet to plug in my how powered gaming pc to test this limit for myself, but just food for thought",

                    "title":"An Honest Review",
                    "review":"Where to begin?  After spending several weeks researching options to upgrade our old 42\" Vizio (model E422VLE) I decided on the Q60A 55\" and was very excited to surprise my wife with the upgrade.  To keep things neat and tidy, let's break it down.Delivery:Amazon did a great job here.  I scheduled it for the earliest available slot (6:30 AM to 9:30 AM) it arrived right around 6:45 AM.  Box was in perfect condition, and the delivery driver helped carry the unit into the house.Unboxing:Samsung really thought this through as well.  After cutting the straps, you can open the top of the box for the accessories, and then simply slide off the main/upper portion of the box to get to the television.  Instructions were clear and easy to read, and the feet easy to install and adjust without tools.Design:The overall design of this TV is fantastic.  I honestly like it more than many higher end options.  The top and side bezels are not only nice and thin, but also a nice matte finish.  So you don't have to worry about any strange glare or reflections along the borders (my biggest gripe with the Vizio, which had monstrous, glossy bezels).  The offset logo is also a nice touch in reducing potential distractions, and it has a downward firing red light when powered off, which shouldn't cause any sleeping issues if this unit is in a bedroom.  Oh, and thin!  This TV is beautifully thin.As a side note: ATTENTIONAL ALL INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS!  Please, PLEASE stop using gloss black on the front-facing surround of screens.  It makes no sense and is needlessly distracting.  Yes, I know it's supposed to look and feel \"premium\", but it just attracts glare, dust, and toddler fingerprints.  Have some fun with matte finishes, different tones of gray, frosted glass or other materials, whatever.  But no more gloss on the front, OK?Setup:I didn't have a Samsung account yet, so I went ahead and got that going.  The authentication text messages seemed to have quite a bit of lag, but once the account was authorized it was pretty simple to to get the TV setup with my cell phone and the SmartThings app.Interface:In general, I liked the interface.  It was simple, easy to navigate, and nice and snappy.  No lag whatsoever.  I did notice some ads for service like HBO Max but this doesn't really bother me since the vast majority of our TV use is through a 4K Apple TV.Picture:Wow.  Just...  WOW!  Coming from the 1080p Vizio (which was honestly a fine TV for being 10 years old, just not 4K) I'm sure most 4K TV's would have been impressive.  Even so, I feel like I can honestly say the straight-out-of-the-box picture was gorgeous.  I didn't fiddle with any picture settings.  The colors popped without being overly saturated, and the blacks felt plenty dark.  All in all it just looked great.  I did notice there was some small, lightly darker spots in both lower corners, and when looking again at the display units at Best Buy noticed it was on their unit as well.  It's not terrible, and on any movies with even minimal letterboxing (like Luca) you won't even notice it.  But on bright backgrounds without a lot of detail it may distract a bit.Sound:Sadly, the sound is where things really started falling apart.  I'd read some reviews that the sound was like \"a cell phone in the 90's\" and thought to myself there's no way that could be true.  And while it isn't quite that bad, in \"Normal\" mode (the default setting) it certainly sounded severely week and hollow.  To the point I couldn't imagine trying to ever listen to anything in that mode.  The middle option, \"Adaptive\" was sufficient, though the bass still felt lacking.  The new iMac - which is significantly smaller and thinner - has significantly more bass and much, much better audio quality than the Q60A, which is disappointing.  But it gets worse...When using a 4K Apple TV the audio randomly, and frequently cuts out.  Sometimes when the next show in a series started to stream, sometimes in the middle of a movie.  Stranger still was that the sound in general still worked - if you pushed the back button to browse again you'd hear the navigation effects and chimes without problem - but go back into the movie/show and there wasn't any audio.  I tried adjusting audio settings, switching to AirPlay speakers (which would work fine) then back to the TV (still no sound), resetting the TV, and searched the Samsung support forums for answers.  Unfortunately it seems like this is a potential issue with this model, and possibly Samsung TV's in general.What's more, once while in the middle of a movie, the sound muted by itself (the remote was on the stand) for no reason at all.  The mute icon just popped up on the screen and stayed that way until I adjusted the volume with the remote.  Not an encouraging sign.I didn't expect spectacular sound, but the combination of what I would call \"just barely adequate sound\" at this price point, combined with the frustration of sound dropping randomly means I'll be sending this unit back.  If I decide to try a replacement of the same model I'll be sure to update my review, but for now I can't see giving any more than 2 stars.Summary:Amazingly colorful, crisp picture with some very subtle clouding in the lower corners, beautiful and thoughtful industrial design, and a clean, snappy interface.  But disappointingly poor sound and unacceptable sound dropping issues.  I would highly advise looking & listening to this model in a store first if at all possible.",

The picture quality is great even though it's using the lite Quantum upscale 4k processor unlike the bigger bothers of the line, however even when watching a 1080p movie, the upscaling does seem to make it much more detailed and higj res. The TV seems smart enough to always know what input I want it in as I turn on different entertainment systems. The user interface in my opinion is pretty straight forward, and you get free access to samsung tv + which provides a whole bunch of free channels, and for someone who hasn't had cable TV in the last decade or so, it's a nice touch. You also get access to all the typical smart TV apps like Netflix, Disney, hulu, prime, funimation, HBO, youtube, crackle, tubi, apple tv, plex, pandora, AMC, spotify, news apps and a browser and a bunchnof others ive yet to install. But bear in mind this is not a full fledged android tv, so apps are plentiful but limited for sure. However I'm surprised that even with the inclusion of Google assistant, I'm unable to cast whatever I want to the TV, besides YouTube and Netflix and other apps that are already included with casting capabilities on the tv, so I had to get a chrome cast to cast my own things.... or maybe im just dumb and iverlooked something. One cool thing though is if u have an android (not sure about iphone), you can control almost everything from the smart things app and project your phone onto the screen and even have multiple things on the screen at a time including your ohine screen as you watch netflix to the other side. For ios users apple airplay is built in. And the integrated alexa/Google assistant/smartthings can be used to control any smart devices u have in your home - smartt lights, robot vaccums, nest thermostats, smart switches and all other alexa/google assistant stuff which is great. As well as getting your phone notifications to show on the tv. And if u have other smart speakers, those can be used control the tv as well.Now unfortunately  for some of the bad. First of all is it's not as pixel clear and bright as it's more expensive order brothers. The viewing radius is good but not great, But by setting the display to dynamic or vivid and the brightness slightly up, it's honestly plenty bright and colorful and clear for me. Second is the built in speakers are okay.... I mean they're not horrible, and can definitely be enjoyable in a smaller area, but there's next to no bass, and voices are a little more pitchy than they should be, so a decent sound bar with a sub will go a long way. Personally i got the samsung HW-650 with DTS virtual x and the included sub woofer for not that much money and it basically as close to a home movie theatre experience now.  My least favorite things though is that it only has 3 hdmi inputs, 1 of which is an hdmi eARC port that I use for my sound bar, which leaves me with just 2 hdmi ports. Perhaps thats more than enough for you, but with a few gaming systems and a sound bar ive already ran through all of them, however you can find high quality cheap hdmi port splitters right here on Amazon so no big deal but still, and luckily my Samsung soundbar has an extra hdmi port that can be accessed through the TV. My last and final gripe I should say is the remote. At first I actually really liked how small and simple and compact it is, it even can charge through solar or USB c. But overtime youll realize that sometimes having more buttons is better as you just end up having to click more buttons to get things done, like changing the input source, opening the settings, finding your apps, and typing in channel numbers. though the alexa/Google assistant functionality does fill in some gaps for sure.Overall I'm thrilled I went with this model despite being able to afford the higher end ones. Sure go for it if you wish, but i would say this will surely suffice you, and you might save enough money to get an even larger tv or better sound system, maybe even a second tv for your room or something.Last thing, I saw some comments about the refresh rate of this tv being just 60hz, however according to the official samsung listing of this exact model, it should be 120hz. I've yet to plug in my how powered gaming pc to test this limit for myself, but just food for thought",

                        "title":"2nd Purchase only Bigger!",
                        "review":"This TV is amazing, AMAZING!First I purchased the Samsung  65” 4K QLED for my bedroom, several months ago and absolutely love it so, I just bought the Same Samsung 4K QLED but,  in 75”, for my LivingRoom.This TV is not only HUGE but, the picture is just so incredible that I would have to say,Mind Blown, Mic Drop.Who thought we’d own TV’s of this size in our homes when, growing up, if you had a 26” Sony, you were the coolest family on the block.I can’t believe how truly affordable these are, yes, I caught both on sale plus, I have 2 Samsung Sound Bars with Subs for each and I’m truly in heaven, again Mind Blowing Picture Size and Unreal 4K Quality in QLED and the Sound with the Soundbar with Sub is just a wonderful, movie theater-ish experience that is a “must have” in today’s world of true Home Theater.Just a side note, since this is turning into. Novel, I plan to upgrade both my Soundbars and Subs to the Klipsch 600 w/surround speakers as soon as I catch a sale (never listen to these speakers at a store as it will make you so unhappy when you listen to what you already have or anything else and honestly, I was so super happy with the sound from my Samsung Soundbar setup).Damn Klipsch for being the Best Sound and the Big Electronics Store for allowing me to hear them, even though I specifically went to that store with the sole intention of hearing the Klipsch system before I would buy them from Amazon.There’s a Huge Difference, I mean Huge Difference from UHD (which I had in the 65” and replaced with a 65” QLED) and QLED, which you see immediately and if you can spend the extra bucks to get QLED, you’ll never regret it, I still can’t believe the difference as I had both a 65” UHD & 65” QLED in my home at the same time and it drove me crazy so, I had to get another QLED ergo this 75” QLED.I bought the 3 year warranty and before you call me a fool/sucker, I will tell you exactly why it’s so very much worth it.What no one tells you (yet you can easily find out if you do a little research) all these Flat Screen TV are considered “Disposable”, to be replaced every 5-7 years as there’s little to near nothing that is fixable or worth the money to fix, that’s a biggie.I actually sold TV’s and other electronics a very long time ago and back then it was mostly a total scam but, not now.I’ve had 2 Flat Screens go out on me in the last 6 years and prices back then were much much higher.My 65” 1080P highest HiDef TV at the time (only $3,000.00 for a 42” LED), well it blew out, died, had a seizure, something or other and it was just out of warranty by only 3 months (of course).I tried everything, called everyone, started off really nice, tried bribing people and eventually went to yelling, cursing hey, Im a New Yorker (that’s a Nu Yawka who lived On Lawn Guyland okay😎lol) and got nowhere, nothing Fougeddabouddit.Finally I was offering to pay a repairman out of pocket but, he told me it just wasn’t worth it.My High Definition LCD Flat Screen went out with the trash (you don’t want to tell the wife that story because you know she was against it, never needed or wanted a big TV in “Her House! we’ll get back to “Her House” later”.I replaced that TV with a 65” 4K UHD TV but, this time I bought the 3 year warranty and wouldn’t you know it, at the very beginning of the second year(isn’t it funny how everything always works great until 12 seconds after the warranty runs out), the screen started to really mess up, there were streaks of light, bright dots and stars, it was just too annoying to watch, especially since our TV’s are now a major part of the home decor.In today’s living room, it’s become the key focal point and the main attraction for which the TV is front and center, then we adjust all the furniture around it.Of course I called the Extended Warranty Company btw & fyi a little heads up so it’ll make sense or not, I’m a New Yorker so, I was already for a fight before anything started, it’s always going to be something and then an argument.I explained the problem bla bla bla and the service rep explained that I was out of the manufacturer’s warranty so, I was correct to contact them but, this was a problem that they were already very familiar with and unfortunately it’s  not a fixable problem.Okay, Here we go, my blood pressure is already rising as I’m waiting to find out how I was scammed.First the Service Rep apologized for it not being a repairable problem and immediately asked when the could Schedule the appointment to pick up my broken TV and bring me a Brand New One, a time that would be convenient for me.Wait, did I hear that correctly, what’s the catch?I asked he to repeat what he said and also to let me know how much out of pocket it was going to cost me for a New TV, that I think he just said, they are bringing me to replace my 2 years old broken TV?Long story short, they delivered a Newer Model as mine was discontinued, they apologized again (poor me they upgraded my broken TV for a newer model, I think I’ll live) and it cost me absolutely zip, zero, zilc, nada, NOTHING!!!I couldn’t wait to tell the Wife this story as I am going to exaggerate, embellish and make up a story of how I had to fight them to get this Newer Model and I wasn’t going to pay them a penny (come on, every guy does this, we all want to be the hero in our wives eyes).It didn’t matter because during this whole fiasco, it turned out the wife was defective too and like she said, the TV was my idea so, I got the New Newer TV for free all for myself and she didn’t get it (of course she got the House, Cars, the Dogs, basically everything but, the TV and Almost All Of My Money for the next too many years, that’s a divorce in New York, it’s all about the ladies and I’m okay with that but, this is about a TV & the Extended Warranty and I got both!!!).The Moral of this Looong Story,The Samsung QLED is a wonderful thing to have in your house, just incredible, nothing comes close (there’s the 8K, it’s better but, if you had the big bucks that 8K TV’s go for, why would you still be reading this?) plus, if you add a Soundbar and Sub, now or later, Chances are you are going to love watching movies at home more than going out, driving to the theater, looking for parking, waiting online to pay ridiculous ticket prices just before you get robbed at the snack bar and don’t forget the super large cup of ice with a splash of soda and your $6.00 stale candy bar  , garbage pail of the saltiest popcorn that’s guaranteed to get you the new high score on the free CVS Blood Pressure Machine, don’t forget your “Fake Butter Flavoring”, now you’re already to sit with a bunch noisy nosey  of strangers, trying to calculate how the bill for the  overpriced snacks were more than the overpriced tickets yet, still unable to stop thinking about why your feet are stuck to those gross floors.Hey, some people just love that theater experience,I think a nice bright 4K QLED in my own hone with a nice sound system, my couch, my new future ex at my side, our own fresh junk food, no strangers annoying us and the best part,Pause for a quick bathroom break plus,Rewind anything you didn’t hear or want to see it again.I will pick Home Theater with my75” Samsung QLED every time (okay some movies should be seen in a theater but, that’s for you to decide, I’m staying home!)Five Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️2 Thumbs up 👍 👍and a whole bunch ofSmileys 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃",

                        "review":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     First off, I want to dispell any bad reviews you may read about this TV. The people who wrote them simply don't know how to do an \"Expert Setup\" on their TV. They obviously think it's \"Plug n' Play\" and that is NOT the case with any TV, not just this one.All TV's are setup at the factory and are set at neutral settings across the board throughout the TV's range. You MUST know how to properly adjust each individual setting to optimize the picture quality!!These settings are located under >Settings>Picture>Expert Settings, on the TV's menu. Don't be afraid to make some mistakes, this is how I learned! You can always hit factory reset and yes, start all over again!!I know how to do this, I'm very experienced on tweaking TV's. Not to scare anyone, but this one took me the better part of 4 days to fine tune, but man, was it time well spent!!I scanned different channels, waited patiently for facial close-ups, making adjustments, and basically got a good sampling of all types of TV viewing. Doing this, eliminates the need to make minor adjustments with certain programs occasionally.I'm very discerning and picky when it comes to a TV's picture quality. Remember, this is only a one-time fine tuning!! Getting this picky only happens once, it won't be a constant hassle during your TV's lifespan. I have dialed in this TV so well, it's like looking out my picture window at real life action, live. In some scenes the people look lifesize!! Wild!!To the average viewer, you may not want to go as far as I did fine tuning your TV, but if you really want to experience the extreme level of excellence that this TV is most definitely capable of, you will find the time to take my advice and just do it!!I bought the 75 inch screen and mounted it on my living room wall like the masterpiece it is! I'm a firm Samsung believer, their quality and technology is top-notch and world-class!!I bought a full-motion wall mount for my installation. It's rated for TV's up to 130lbs. With a full-motion mount, it makes connecting cables very easy. Just pull it out from the wall and turn it to the left, that's where the USB/HDMI ports are. You can easily get behind the TV by doing this.If you need more USB/HDMI ports than are provided, there are 3, you can buy splitter hubs to turn one port into 2, 3 or more. Just be sure they are 4K splitters.Additionally, I recommend using a Bi-Directional splitter. It allows to either \"input one\" port, in to \"2 output ports,\" or reverse it to \"2 input ports,\" to \"one output port.\". (Depending on your specific needs.) These types of splitters are used for connecting other components to your TV. A button on top of the splitter allows you to switch between TV mode, to Blu-ray player or DVR etc.Note: If you're going to mount your TV on a wall, be sure to use a stud-finder to locate the wall studs. DO NOT mount your TV onto just drywall or paneling alone. My wall is thick pine paneling, drywall, and concrete block behind that.I used a 8\" concrete drill bit and lag-bolted the mount with lead concrete anchors, directly into solid concrete. It's not going anywhere anytime soon!!I also bought a wireless keyboard and mouse so I can easily access the TV's internet capabilities. With Alexa included, I just say into the voice remote, \"Alexa, open the internet.\" And she opens it to my home page. This is just one example of what Alexa can do, the list is seemingly endless. If you have other smart devices in your home, they can be programmed into this TV and controlled by using Alexa as well.As I write this review I am watching my big-screen as you would a computer monitor or smartphone screen and I have the Pandora music app pumping my favorite music thru my home stereo in the background. For me, this online multi-combination is great for reading/writing emails, playing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc, paying bills, shopping or just browsing the web.And I would be remiss if I forgot to mention the voice remote!! No more batteries to change out! This remote has an indoor solar panel on the back! Bout time someone thought of that! It also has USB charging if you prefer. Its slim design is simple to use and easy to learn.I am simply blown away with this TV! I have it wired into my 1,000 watt per channel home stereo and I'm so glad I live in a cinder block house, not a glass one!! I'm waiting for the day I accidently blowout my picture window!!The combination of the big-screen and my sound system is like sitting front and center at the movie theater. Extremely impressive!For the price,  (It was $1497 at the time I purchased this 2021 model,) this TV is an amazing deal if you can't afford the upper class models, such as the Q70's, Q80's or Q90's.One hint for the not so tech savvy. You MUST upgrade your cable box/satellite service to 4K. This TV won't give you a 4K picture thru a cable or satellite box unless you do. Then check your cable box settings to make sure it configures correctly at boot-up and is set to 4K resolution.This upgrade should include using 4K HDR HDMI cables, NOT standard HDMI cables. So consult your cable or satellite service for what you will need to receive a true 4K (3840X2160) UHD picture. One other hint: Double-check your cable box video setting to be sure it configures correctly! Some boxes, even though 4K, will default to standard HD (1080P) or even 720P. If this is the case with yours, scroll to the 2160P setting and lock your picture into 4K. I have deep, rich blacks and bright, vivid colors that explode off the screen and come to life with true to life flesh tones as well. This is the result of the HDR (High Dynamic Range.)  Simply put, it enhances brightness, contrast and color levels significantly.I can actually tell the difference between a person in a black suit and a person in a very dark blue one! This tells me my brightness, contrast and color levels are set perfectly.Please don't judge this TV's picture quality by my cellphone pictures and short video! They truly don't do this TV justice. You have to see it in person, and just take my word for it that it's just absolutely incredible!All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase, and I am sure if you know what you're doing, you can set it up perfectly to your liking. Or if you can't, ask a techie friend you may have, we all know one or two!!Just a quick note: I noticed that it appears that this comment page lists posts from owners with a wide range of TV models and sizes.For the record, I am experiencing outstanding results as I just described with the SAMSUNG 75-Inch Class QLED Q60A Series - 4K UHD Dual LED Quantum HDR Smart TV with Alexa Built-in (QN75Q60AAFXZA, 2021 Model)I can't speak to any other models. I hope your choice is as good as mine was!!Good luck!Jeff StearnsWhitehall, MI.",

                        "review":"I purchased this Samsung to upgrade our small family room's media setup. The value for the price is excellent.I have read several reviews for TV with a wide variety of opinions on it. Seems like a lot of them are by customers looking for elite quality products at lower end price and are disappointed that it didn't meet expectations. In my opinion this is a quality product.First let's talk about the TV itself. The manufacturers box was delivered with minimal denting to the box. Obviously with a 50 inch flat panel it's difficult to find a shipping box for it so I was prepared for any normal shipping bumps and bruises. The package itself was light enough that my 8 yr old could bring it in with zero issues.  Removing the TV from the box and accompanying Styrofoam, I was shocked by how thin it was. You could mount this on the wall and it would be on par with hanging pucture frames.The initial setup was fast and easy. Plug in the power, use the three HDMI spots to hook up your devices and let the setup search for channels. I chose to hardwire mine to my home network using an unmanaged switch because we have a lot of wifi devices running in the house and the demand on the network isn't getting any lower. I don't typically gush over remotes but I will this time. It's small light weight and features a rechargeable battery using solar power or charging port. That's right I said solar, flip this thing over in the light and let it do its thing. It also can be used to control other devices with no problem.  There is a bit of a learning curve on using it but it can be quickly mastered.The picture quality is insane. I bought a couple of 4k HDMI cables to try out just how clear the picture could be.  During football season I watched a few games on high definition channels and the quality was almost to good and when they switched to high-def cameras during the broadcast it seemed like I was playing a game. I streamed several NHL hockey games and it was like attending a game. I haven't purchased a 4K UHD bluray player yet so I used my Xbox one to try out how it works as 4k player. I had ordered each Star Wars movie in 4k to try them out. The quality was so good it began to approach the level of looking fake. The sharpness and detail during space scenes made it look like models in a special effects shot. In close ups you can actually see the slightest scar or blemish on an actors face. Almost makes you want to lower the quality just to suspend disbelief for a movie.As far as using it for gaming again it just shines. Switching from a 10 year old flat panel to the Samsung 50 inch was like the difference between the original NES and Playstation 5. Playing my sports game was almost like a real broadcast. My kids played  Call of Duty WWII and the storming of Omaha Beach was like watching Saving Private Ryan's opening sequence.  Almost no lag and the backgrounds were excellent.  It's a great gaming experience.Odds and ends: I paired a soundbar with it via Bluetooth and had no problems and great sound. The remote even automatically programed itself to control the speaker. There are some different settings that work with to change your viewing experience but I haven't dived into them fully. The smart TV apps seem to work flawlessly when linked to my Netflix and Amazon prime accounts but I use another device for those as well so haven't tested them fully.All in all if you are looking for a mid-teir TV this fits the bill in every way. If you are a serious videophile or audiophile than this will probably be solid but not what you are  looking for. For your 2nd, third, or even fourth setup in your home it will do the job nicely.",

                        "title":"Battle of the 32\" inches  - TV (Samsung QN32Q60A) or Monitor (LG 32UL500-W) for mixed use?",
                        "review":"This review is for the 32\" model QN32Q60AAFXZA. I was looking for a 32\" screen with HDR for mixed use as a PC monitor and TV in my garage while exercising on my elliptical trainer. I wasn't sure if getting a TV or 4K HDR monitor was the way to go since TVs tend to render text poorly, while monitors render HDR poorly. I have a PC and a Amazon FireTV stick hooked to a HDMI switcher connected to the screen and so I did not care for smart features.I tried out both the QN32Q60AAFXZA and the LG 32UL500-W 32\" HDR 4K monitor (which is actually better than its successor LG 32UN500-W model). I have an LG OLED and so deeper blacks is something I am sensitive to and care deeply about. TL;DR, the Samsung won with distinctly darker blacks and punchier contrast, while maintaining very good text clarity for PC and so I ended up ponying $200 more for the Samsung over the LG.Comparing the rtings reviews of both of these, the Samsung has 50% more contrast ratio (Samsung's 4,653:1 vs. LG's 2,883:1) and ~200 nits higher brightness (HDR Real Scene: Samsung's 468 cd/m2 vs. LG's 242 cd/m2) which shows. However, Samsung's 32\" screen size differs from other sizes in that it doesn't come with dual LED. This appears to reduce both color accuracy and brightness by 5~10% compared to other models from what I read online. What was surprising was that rtings stated better viewing angles on the LG (6.6 avg score vs. 5.7 score of the samsung's) but it was the reverse in my experience. The LG's screen felt more washed out as I moved around even small amounts that I did not experience with the Samsung. I do not do color sensitive work, and so I did not evaluate color accuracy where the LG might have a lead. As far as PC use is concerned, it is good.The HDR performance on the Samsung is still subpar, with content needing high brightness (like metallic objects) unable to really standout (e.g. like the coronation scene in \"Gods of Egypt\", and the golden threads in the circus scenes in the \"The Greatest Showman\"). rtings stated as much and apparently you need 600+ nits of brightness to get that. But for normally lit scenes, everything looks fantastic. However, to keep things in perspective, even my Vizio 40\" (V405-H9) which costs nearly half the Samsung has a higher contrast ratio and looks better in HDR in my darker room. Goes on to emphasize that if you are flexible and can go with larger TV sizes (esp. 55\") then far better options really open up.The Samsung is noticeably more compact in size (perhaps 1/2\" smaller in all directions) and the power supply is built into the TV (with a paltry 4 foot power cord), while the LG has a bulky external power supply. I use a 3rd party 100mm VESA mount and so I didn't try out the stands. Samsung requires registration to do anything useful with it, but if you simply need to use a HDMI input, you can actually do that with just the basic setup - no need to put it on the internet or sign up for a Samsung account. Also you can use your smart phone as a remote and skip the included remote which has a weird solar based charging and non-intuitive buttons. Its best to skip Samsung's ecosystem entirely and invest in a Fire TV 4K stick, Google TV, or a Roku 4K stick.I like a touch of vivid (i.e., not color accurate) without it being too obnoxious like in the Dynamic picture mode - these are the settings that I preferred on the Samsung. Once I set these, I then tweaked the color settings in windows to improve the PC contrast and colors without affecting TV watching - unfortunately there are no user saved profiles that you can save and switch easily:Picture Mode = FILMMAKER MODEExpert settings:Brightness = 50Contrast = 50Sharpness = 5Color = 35Tint = 0Picture Clarity Settings = OffContrast Enhancer = OffColor Tone = StandardGamma > ST.2084 = 3Shadow Detail = -2 (minus 2 for darker blacks; adjust this higher to -1 or 0 if you want to trade off darker black levels for more shadow detail instead - tweak this setting along with the Gamma > ST.2084 value to suit your tastes)Color Space Settings = NativeGeneral > Power and Energy Saving > Brightness Optimization = OffGeneral > Power and Energy Saving > Brightness Reduction = OffGeneral > Power and Energy Saving > Motion Lighting = Off",

Current market very hard to find small screen size 4K TVs, especially with decent audio output.The VERY bad: Uses Samsung Tizen OS (operating system), NOT Android OS. Means you are LIMITED to streaming apps provided by Samsung. Means you can't install .APK sideload apps. Took forever to figure this out, as most web searches give info on how to sideload apps on Samsung \"smart TVs\", no explanation that Tizen smart TVs are different than all other Samsung Android smart TVs. This would have been a deal breaker if I had known before purchasing this TV, as there are a number of apps I use, including NYRA horse racing app, not available via the LIMITED Samsung app library of 20 or so apps offered. REALLY BAD Samsung decision to use \"TIZEN\" OS, to save $ I assume! If you want to use streaming apps primarily without need for HDMI source, I recommend you AVOID!",

                        "title":"An Honest Review",
                        "review":"Where to begin?  After spending several weeks researching options to upgrade our old 42\" Vizio (model E422VLE) I decided on the Q60A 55\" and was very excited to surprise my wife with the upgrade.  To keep things neat and tidy, let's break it down.Delivery:Amazon did a great job here.  I scheduled it for the earliest available slot (6:30 AM to 9:30 AM) it arrived right around 6:45 AM.  Box was in perfect condition, and the delivery driver helped carry the unit into the house.Unboxing:Samsung really thought this through as well.  After cutting the straps, you can open the top of the box for the accessories, and then simply slide off the main/upper portion of the box to get to the television.  Instructions were clear and easy to read, and the feet easy to install and adjust without tools.Design:The overall design of this TV is fantastic.  I honestly like it more than many higher end options.  The top and side bezels are not only nice and thin, but also a nice matte finish.  So you don't have to worry about any strange glare or reflections along the borders (my biggest gripe with the Vizio, which had monstrous, glossy bezels).  The offset logo is also a nice touch in reducing potential distractions, and it has a downward firing red light when powered off, which shouldn't cause any sleeping issues if this unit is in a bedroom.  Oh, and thin!  This TV is beautifully thin.As a side note: ATTENTIONAL ALL INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS!  Please, PLEASE stop using gloss black on the front-facing surround of screens.  It makes no sense and is needlessly distracting.  Yes, I know it's supposed to look and feel \"premium\", but it just attracts glare, dust, and toddler fingerprints.  Have some fun with matte finishes, different tones of gray, frosted glass or other materials, whatever.  But no more gloss on the front, OK?Setup:I didn't have a Samsung account yet, so I went ahead and got that going.  The authentication text messages seemed to have quite a bit of lag, but once the account was authorized it was pretty simple to to get the TV setup with my cell phone and the SmartThings app.Interface:In general, I liked the interface.  It was simple, easy to navigate, and nice and snappy.  No lag whatsoever.  I did notice some ads for service like HBO Max but this doesn't really bother me since the vast majority of our TV use is through a 4K Apple TV.Picture:Wow.  Just...  WOW!  Coming from the 1080p Vizio (which was honestly a fine TV for being 10 years old, just not 4K) I'm sure most 4K TV's would have been impressive.  Even so, I feel like I can honestly say the straight-out-of-the-box picture was gorgeous.  I didn't fiddle with any picture settings.  The colors popped without being overly saturated, and the blacks felt plenty dark.  All in all it just looked great.  I did notice there was some small, lightly darker spots in both lower corners, and when looking again at the display units at Best Buy noticed it was on their unit as well.  It's not terrible, and on any movies with even minimal letterboxing (like Luca) you won't even notice it.  But on bright backgrounds without a lot of detail it may distract a bit.Sound:Sadly, the sound is where things really started falling apart.  I'd read some reviews that the sound was like \"a cell phone in the 90's\" and thought to myself there's no way that could be true.  And while it isn't quite that bad, in \"Normal\" mode (the default setting) it certainly sounded severely week and hollow.  To the point I couldn't imagine trying to ever listen to anything in that mode.  The middle option, \"Adaptive\" was sufficient, though the bass still felt lacking.  The new iMac - which is significantly smaller and thinner - has significantly more bass and much, much better audio quality than the Q60A, which is disappointing.  But it gets worse...When using a 4K Apple TV the audio randomly, and frequently cuts out.  Sometimes when the next show in a series started to stream, sometimes in the middle of a movie.  Stranger still was that the sound in general still worked - if you pushed the back button to browse again you'd hear the navigation effects and chimes without problem - but go back into the movie/show and there wasn't any audio.  I tried adjusting audio settings, switching to AirPlay speakers (which would work fine) then back to the TV (still no sound), resetting the TV, and searched the Samsung support forums for answers.  Unfortunately it seems like this is a potential issue with this model, and possibly Samsung TV's in general.What's more, once while in the middle of a movie, the sound muted by itself (the remote was on the stand) for no reason at all.  The mute icon just popped up on the screen and stayed that way until I adjusted the volume with the remote.  Not an encouraging sign.I didn't expect spectacular sound, but the combination of what I would call \"just barely adequate sound\" at this price point, combined with the frustration of sound dropping randomly means I'll be sending this unit back.  If I decide to try a replacement of the same model I'll be sure to update my review, but for now I can't see giving any more than 2 stars.Summary:Amazingly colorful, crisp picture with some very subtle clouding in the lower corners, beautiful and thoughtful industrial design, and a clean, snappy interface.  But disappointingly poor sound and unacceptable sound dropping issues.  I would highly advise looking & listening to this model in a store first if at all possible.",

                        "review":"Right out of the box and on the wall, I loved the picture quality. Sharp, beautiful colors, deep blacks. A real joy to watch programs on. But, to cut to the chase, the sound quality from the built-in speakers is absolutely horrific. There's almost no bass - it's all very tinny treble, and no amount of adjusting the settings can pump up the bass so that there's a natural sound coming out of those speakers. Yes, I've tried everything recommended in online Samsung forums, as this issue seems to be common, but nothing works. Obviously, I could bypass this issue with a sound bar, but there's no place for one in the small space that we have for this TV in our kitchen. I do use Apple HomePod Minis for when I switch to Apple tv streaming, and the sound out of those is great (and they're easy to place on the kitchen counter below the TV), but they can't be used with regular (non-streamed) television viewing.This is such a shame, as our old LG TV had superb sound from its speakers - deep, rich bass and easy to use settings. I've contacted Samsung about this issue, but received standard replies about how to use the settings to change the sound output. Yes, I know how to do that, even though the controls aren't very intuitive and buried somewhat deep. I'm always amazed at a company that does something so right - like the wonderful picture quality of this TV - and then just falls so short in other areas. Anyway, if you get this TV, you take your chances. I give the picture quality high marks, and the speakers a mere 1 star, so the whole thing averages out to 3 stars. I'm so disappointed.",
