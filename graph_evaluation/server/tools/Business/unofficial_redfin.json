My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

The teachers were dedicated to their jobs, the courses were challenging, and it prepared us for college. However, the non-honors programs in the school are very poor. Security was always an issue, and students were free to roam the halls with little consequence. My advise is that if you're attending the IPS or honors program, you will be pleased with the quality of education. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",

The school is notorious for kids being bullied, and security arriving way too late, and if they don't get you in school they will get you after school. There must be a change this has been going on for years!!!! Kids are bused from other locations, and sometime not the best neighborhoods, to ensure the school is integrated, and this does have an affect to population and to those who live in the area.",

The teachers are very unexperienced and have no control over the classroom. The kids there are ruthless fights all the time as well as bullying. The only thing is good is the teams and vet. Course. But overall this school is terrible . Even from my own experience when I used to go there a lot of kids used to pick on me and try to hurt me . My teachers even new about this but yet had no control. One day I was driven out the classroom but them and left the school while no one stopped me not even the teachers or deans or security I just walked out crying. This school only focuses on sport teams and being on the news about it. Nothing more. Really a disappointment.",

If you try, you will learn as much as you please. If you don't, you wont. The school, in a way, successfully separates students based on their averages by the application of two programs : IPS and Gilder Lehrman. The students who are known to be violent are therefore in a whole different world than you, so violence is out of the question. This school, because of the high number of students with low averages, has to focus on the failings kids instead of the ones who attain a 90-100 average. There are therefore only about 6 AP classes, and 5-6 college now (Which isn't that bad) Don't be fooled, thought, because if you have a good GPA, you will get an enormous amount of extra classes.",

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

The teachers were dedicated to their jobs, the courses were challenging, and it prepared us for college. However, the non-honors programs in the school are very poor. Security was always an issue, and students were free to roam the halls with little consequence. My advise is that if you're attending the IPS or honors program, you will be pleased with the quality of education. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",

The school is notorious for kids being bullied, and security arriving way too late, and if they don't get you in school they will get you after school. There must be a change this has been going on for years!!!! Kids are bused from other locations, and sometime not the best neighborhoods, to ensure the school is integrated, and this does have an affect to population and to those who live in the area.",

The teachers are very unexperienced and have no control over the classroom. The kids there are ruthless fights all the time as well as bullying. The only thing is good is the teams and vet. Course. But overall this school is terrible . Even from my own experience when I used to go there a lot of kids used to pick on me and try to hurt me . My teachers even new about this but yet had no control. One day I was driven out the classroom but them and left the school while no one stopped me not even the teachers or deans or security I just walked out crying. This school only focuses on sport teams and being on the news about it. Nothing more. Really a disappointment.",

If you try, you will learn as much as you please. If you don't, you wont. The school, in a way, successfully separates students based on their averages by the application of two programs : IPS and Gilder Lehrman. The students who are known to be violent are therefore in a whole different world than you, so violence is out of the question. This school, because of the high number of students with low averages, has to focus on the failings kids instead of the ones who attain a 90-100 average. There are therefore only about 6 AP classes, and 5-6 college now (Which isn't that bad) Don't be fooled, thought, because if you have a good GPA, you will get an enormous amount of extra classes.",

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

She is an AMAZING teacher, so experienced, caring and kind. The atmosphere that she creates in class makes the children love school and thrive. The parent-teacher coordinator Ms Gina is very approachable and friendly. The school is clean and it seems like the staff is kind, open, and friendly (with the exception of security guards who are often very rude) However, the reading requirement that are pushed and the amount of testing done in Kindergarden is INAPPROPRIATE for children of this age group. The constant testing creates unnecessary amount of stress for five year old children, especially for the English language learners that make up about 1/3 of our class. I also feel that not enough time is dedicated to the arts. Otherwise, its a very nice neighborhood school.",

We came here with just our clothes on our backs. My experience at P.S. was tough but I took alot away from that. One specific teacher Mrs. Beatrice, who taught 5th graders, made a big difference in my life. She enlisted in me the importance of self confidence and that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. Though they were not her exact words but it was hers actions and continous attention to each student as an individual that I still remember to this day. From that point I went onto graduate high school, complete my bachelor's degree, and then entered medical school. I completed my residency and am currently an emergency medicine physician. Thank you Mrs. Beatrice, where ever you are!!",

Disrespectful and unprofessional leadership!!! A lot of parents transferring their kids to another schools due to rudeness of the principal Spagnolo and some of the teachers. One of them is Zucconi. She is unprofessional, utterly incompetent and cynical. All parents, please be carful if youâ€™ll hear this name and PLEASE RUN AWAY from her and this terrible school !!! This aloof, grumpy and aggressive person canâ€™t be working at the school !!! PLEASE, DONâ€™T LET THE PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATORS AT THE PS 100 MOCK AND CRIPPLE OUR CHILDREN !!! Our kids deserves better schools environment and professional teachers!!!",

This year they combined PS 100 or something and was not aware until the 1st day of school. These teachers sound so overwhelmed. Canâ€™t even remember a conversation they held with a specific child.

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

The people bullying me should have been kicked out but the staff at this school is unprofessional and donâ€™t care about the people that go to this school. Donâ€™t waste your time on this school.

I think kids who go here , have a better chance to get into the highschool they want. The only complain I would make is those stupid door and staircase rules, I got in trouble once and lectured for going in the \"Out\" door. and also the gym teachers think they are drill sargents and will give you a 10 hour lecture if you forget to bring your gym shoes or clothes or locker. Some moments I had were so awkward where I would do the tiniest thing wrong and get bothered about it for 3 weeks, it could be the teacher but the vibe I got from the school was sometimes awkward. Despite those moments, I loved performing for my school and watching other kids performe. I had so many memories here and wouldnt trade it for the world ;)",

I definetly will not reccomend this school to any student. Academics are not challenging and this school does not prepare you for college. I transferred as a freshman to a much better high school. I left grady with a 99 average with absolutely no studying. This school is horrible horrible, i hated this school so much the bullying, the gangs, violence.",

I went on to earn a masters degree and currently work in state government. I have to agree with others who have stated school is what you make it. I'm pleased to see Grady still offers a wide variety of programs. I don't think people realize how important vocational and technical schools are, especially in today's world. Students who are smart enough to take advantage of the programs Grady has to offer will be well positioned for future success. The shortage of skilled labor and trained technicians is well documented. Every city should have a few schools like Grady. What I learned in Grady has served me well in everyday life. The confidence I have in working with my hands to build and fix things came from my vocational experience. It is also where I was first challenged to problem solve in a real way. Even though I didn't apply myself as I should have while in school, my diploma from Grady gave me many options. I am proud of my degrees, but they are truly no better than a solid vocational/technical education.",

I even asked one of the teacher why the slack in the administrative and security system but he's response is that the students are not in prison and they can't put lock on the back doors. But at least an alarm will do to notify the authority if any student want to sneak out. Academically, the students are poor with low grade in reagent exams. They are either in the hallway, stairways or playground during class session. I just don't like the school and I've been trying to remove my son from there.",

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

The teachers were dedicated to their jobs, the courses were challenging, and it prepared us for college. However, the non-honors programs in the school are very poor. Security was always an issue, and students were free to roam the halls with little consequence. My advise is that if you're attending the IPS or honors program, you will be pleased with the quality of education. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",

The school is notorious for kids being bullied, and security arriving way too late, and if they don't get you in school they will get you after school. There must be a change this has been going on for years!!!! Kids are bused from other locations, and sometime not the best neighborhoods, to ensure the school is integrated, and this does have an affect to population and to those who live in the area.",

The teachers are very unexperienced and have no control over the classroom. The kids there are ruthless fights all the time as well as bullying. The only thing is good is the teams and vet. Course. But overall this school is terrible . Even from my own experience when I used to go there a lot of kids used to pick on me and try to hurt me . My teachers even new about this but yet had no control. One day I was driven out the classroom but them and left the school while no one stopped me not even the teachers or deans or security I just walked out crying. This school only focuses on sport teams and being on the news about it. Nothing more. Really a disappointment.",

If you try, you will learn as much as you please. If you don't, you wont. The school, in a way, successfully separates students based on their averages by the application of two programs : IPS and Gilder Lehrman. The students who are known to be violent are therefore in a whole different world than you, so violence is out of the question. This school, because of the high number of students with low averages, has to focus on the failings kids instead of the ones who attain a 90-100 average. There are therefore only about 6 AP classes, and 5-6 college now (Which isn't that bad) Don't be fooled, thought, because if you have a good GPA, you will get an enormous amount of extra classes.",

My friend went to this school with me and she was barely able to speak English. She once got lost on her way down to lunch. A teacher saw her and my friend was screamed at by the teacher until my friend was reduced to tears. Bullying is not taken seriously here. I was a bullying victim and how was the situation \"taken care of\"? A talk with the assistant principal. Other than that, no serious punishments were carried out. The building's 4th floor is also home to PS 771, making manners even worse for the students AND the staff. If bullying occurs in lower/elementary grade(s), do NOT take this lightly because in middle school the issue has a very high chance of escalating to violence, even on school grounds! Do not send your kid here unless he/she has physical strength and a quick wit.",

The school had been an excellent experience for the whole family and I seen my child blossom academically and in character. He is advanced in math and science and the school had worked closely with him to provide him enrichment work to continue to challenge himself, while working with him on strengthening his academic weaknesses. As importantly he is growing up to be a respectful and confident young man all due to the character traits that are taught and emphasized in school.",

The teachers were dedicated to their jobs, the courses were challenging, and it prepared us for college. However, the non-honors programs in the school are very poor. Security was always an issue, and students were free to roam the halls with little consequence. My advise is that if you're attending the IPS or honors program, you will be pleased with the quality of education. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.",

The school is notorious for kids being bullied, and security arriving way too late, and if they don't get you in school they will get you after school. There must be a change this has been going on for years!!!! Kids are bused from other locations, and sometime not the best neighborhoods, to ensure the school is integrated, and this does have an affect to population and to those who live in the area.",

The teachers are very unexperienced and have no control over the classroom. The kids there are ruthless fights all the time as well as bullying. The only thing is good is the teams and vet. Course. But overall this school is terrible . Even from my own experience when I used to go there a lot of kids used to pick on me and try to hurt me . My teachers even new about this but yet had no control. One day I was driven out the classroom but them and left the school while no one stopped me not even the teachers or deans or security I just walked out crying. This school only focuses on sport teams and being on the news about it. Nothing more. Really a disappointment.",

If you try, you will learn as much as you please. If you don't, you wont. The school, in a way, successfully separates students based on their averages by the application of two programs : IPS and Gilder Lehrman. The students who are known to be violent are therefore in a whole different world than you, so violence is out of the question. This school, because of the high number of students with low averages, has to focus on the failings kids instead of the ones who attain a 90-100 average. There are therefore only about 6 AP classes, and 5-6 college now (Which isn't that bad) Don't be fooled, thought, because if you have a good GPA, you will get an enormous amount of extra classes.",
