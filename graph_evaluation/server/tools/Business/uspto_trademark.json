Duplicate owner results can be returned by this endpoint, especially when an owner had an address change.\n\nUse this method to run a owner search call on an *array* of search terms. We accept up to 100 keywords, each keyword must be more than 4 characters long.  We return up to 25 000 items, with pagination support. \n\nHow BATCH mode works:\n\n**1. The initial call**\n\nWill run the request and will return a *scroll_id *hash, and no results. \nThis call consumes MULTIPLE RapidAPI request credits. It consumes as many request credits as many keywords you have used.  Eg: calling with 10 keywords, will consume from your quota 10 credits. \n\n**2. Pagination call**\n\nOn the same endpoint when you do another request with the scroll_id added as param, you are able to access the results based on the *start_index *parameter. These calls do not consume any RapidAPI request credits. Returns up to 250 results in a single call. Once you obtained the scroll_id, you can call the pagination call in parallel, it's not necessary to call it sequentially. \n\nExample logic:\n\n**The initial call:**\nparams needed: keywords\n\nconsumes: count(keywords) credits. \nreturns: \n- requests: The number of credits used from your quota.

To paginate the result set use the returned `scroll_id `and `start_index `parameters.  `start_index` acts as skip N entries logic when pagination through the results set. \n\nA `scroll_id` is expected to be available for 2 hours, so please pull all the pages in this timeframe for optimal use. \n\nNote:  USPTO doesn't contain and set a direct `expiration_date` for trademarks, instead there are renewal periods that the trademark owner must take to signal they still use the trademarks. This renewal period opens 1 year before the projected expiration date. The projected expiration date doesn't take into account if the renewal did happen recently.",
