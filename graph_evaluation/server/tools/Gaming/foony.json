You will have 60 seconds to join the room on at least 1 client.\n\nPlayers will be able to play any of the available Foony games from this room without additional charge so long as the room remains open.\n\nOn success, the result will contain an embeddable room URL that can be included in any iframe. You may add 1 or more additional options below to further customize the look and feel of the embed:\n\n`&chat=false` Enables chat features (default true)\n`&items=false` Shows item acquisition / customization (default true)\n`&xp=false` Shows experience and levels (default true)\n`&lobbyHeader=false` Shows the lobby header allowing players to adjust game settings (default true)\n`&spectate=true` Joins the player as a spectator. Spectators can view other players in the game and chat (if enabled), but can't participate themselves.\n`&hostSecret=16to64CharacterSecret` If provided, the embedded client will join the room and take over as Host and room creator, giving them special permissions such as the ability to start the game and change settings in the room. Only 1 player should have this in their embed. To use this feature, you must include the hostSecret in your room creation request, and you will need to add the hostSecret to the end of the response's embedUrl.\n\nSupported gameIds:\n* [battleships](https://foony.com/games/battleblobs) - BattleBlobs\n* [checkers](https://foony.com/games/checkers) - Checkers Online + Draughts\n* [chess](https://foony.com/games/chess) - Chess\n* [dinomight](https://foony.com/games/dinomight) - Dino-Might (inspired by Bomberman)\n* [foonyflippers](https://foony.com/games/foono) - Foon-o (inspired by Uno Online)\n* [fourinarow](https://foony.com/games/4-in-a-row-connect) - 4 in a Row Connect\n* [paintjob](https://foony.com/games/paintjob) - Paintjob\n* [typeroyale](https://foony.com/games/typeroyale) - TypeRoyale\n* [wordhunt](https://foony.com/games/popaword) - Pop-A-Word\n\nEach game has its own configuration options.\n\nIf you don't understand any of the options, feel free to reach out to us at support@foony.com and we'll be happy to help.",
