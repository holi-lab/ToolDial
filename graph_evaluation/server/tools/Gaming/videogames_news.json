While players are having a great time with the drastically new collection of units, combos, and in-game mechanics, many are frustrated with changes that have been made to the battle pass. The main source of ire stems from the removal of Little Legend eggs. Before, players who invested enough time into the set could expect some eggs as a reward, regardless of whether they were paying for the premium pass or not. These would grant a random Little Legend - an upgradable player avatar - from across the game's life. For those who paid for the pass, new Little Legends from the current set were easily attainable. However, these eggs have been poached from the battle pass by Riot Games, replaced with a new kind of currency called Treasure Tokens. Rather than collect the eggs directly, players can now spend these Treasure tokens in the Treasure Realms. It's a gacha system, a style of reward system which has players spend currency for randomised rewards. If you've not experienced one before, the term has its roots in gachapon Japanese toy machines, but you can think of it like a sort of video game slot machine that pays out cosmetics rather than cash.

The best io games conjure up images of sitting bored at school or work and looking for something to keep you occupied that\u2019ll make it past your network\u2019s filters. The term 'io games' actually refers to the '.io' domain, but that's not the only element that bonds these games. The genre blossomed from the popularity of Agar.io, and so most of these games emulate the gameplay of Agar and involve moving around, hoovering up smaller creatures than you. No need to clear any room on your hard drive - the best io games can be played on anything from low-specced machines to the best gaming PCs. All the heavy lifting is done on the website to ensure you can play these games anywhere. From puzzle games to battle royale games, the best io games will keep you entertained for at least the next ten minutes, and might just eat up the rest of your day and compete with the best PC games for your attention - you\u2019ve been warned.",
