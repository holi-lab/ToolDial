            "description": "Halisi-Human Face detection API detects human faces in images and retrieves bounding box co-ordinates.\n\nTo get started, encode your image to Base64 and copy the result. Then insert the Base64 result in the Request Body section, as indicated in the example below.\n\nNext, you can pass values in the range [0 - 1] for Confidence and IoU Thresholds, as optional parameters.\n\nFinally, you can test the Endpoint.\n\nPlease note that you need to be subscribed to our API in order to get started with the Halisi experience! Sign Up to the RapidAPI platform and use the auto-generated X-RapidAPI-Key to unlock more Halisi features!\n\nIn a nutshell, the Halisi-Human Face Detection API accepts the following inputs:\n\n1. Base64 image\n2. Confidence threshold (Optional parameter, default = 0.45)\n3. IoU threshold (Optional parameter, default = 0.45)\n\nand retrieves:\n1. Bounding box co-ordinates  (format: [left_x, top_y, right_x, bottom_y] )\n2. Detection scores (between 0 and 1)\n3. Elapsed time\n4. Response status",
