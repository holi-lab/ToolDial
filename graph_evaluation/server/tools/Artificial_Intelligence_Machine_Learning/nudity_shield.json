The server will process the request and return a response indicating whether the image is safe or unsafe.\n\nIt's important to note that the value of the \"image\" key is expected to be a valid base64 representation of the image. Additionally, it is recommended that the images are of reasonable size and comply with common image formats such as JPEG or PNG to achieve better classification results.",
