In simple terms, it is learning by doing. The Open University is pioneering enquiry-based learning in which students meet virtually once a fortnight with a facilitator via Adobe Connect in small groups consisting of seven to 10 students. Students will typically be employed in practice while studying, so they should be encouraged to bring examples from their on-the-job experience to help them efficiently match the theory and practice and spark discussion in the wider group.",

But didn't Shakespeare say, 'Let's kill all the lawyers'? That perchance we may also speak without trepidation. And so it was a delight to learn that soon after Judge Romeo Buenaventura of the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court Branch 256 denied the petition for bail of former senator Leila de Lima and her coaccused who have been behind bars for more than six years, the justices of the Supreme Court issued a statement to the effect that denial of bail did not necessarily mean an imminent conviction.",

The recent crypto platform bankruptcies trapped customer assets now worth about $34 billion, according to Xclaim, which allows creditors to trade such claims. To protect themselves, institutional crypto investors are switching to exchanges that offer stronger asset protection, boosting due diligence on trading partners, and executing trades in smaller chunks, among other new risk management measures, according to executives and industry data.",

Since Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought Twitter, the site has struggled to attract advertisers, who are wary of ad placement after the company laid off hundreds of employees.
