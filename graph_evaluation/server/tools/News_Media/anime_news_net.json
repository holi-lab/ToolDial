The magazine published the manga's 23rd chapter in May 2021.\n\n\nNishikata launched the manga in Love Jossie in 2015. Hakusensha published the manga's fourth compiled book volume in April 2018.\n\n\n\nSeven Seas licensed the manga under its Steamship imprint, and will publish the third volume in English on April 4. Seven Seas describes the story:\n\nFujii Sayo has worked hard to climb the ranks at her firm, and she won't let anything stand in her way\u2013even if it costs her lover after lover. Enter her new colleague: Kiriyama Ryouichi. He's obedient enough in the boardroom, but in private, he's challenging and flirtatious\u2013he wants her and he isn't afraid to show it. After falling into bed with him once and insisting it won't happen again, Ryouichi has an assertion of his own: she'll give in. The two agree to an affair that will only last until Sayo finds someone more suitable to her station and temperament, but Ryouichi is confident he'll win against any other man. Thus begins a sizzling game of push and pull that will set their office alight!\n\n\nNishikata's Venus Capriccio manga launched in Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine in 2005. Hakusensha published the manga's fifth and final volume in 2008. The now-defunct CMX Manga published the manga in English.\n\n\n\nSource: Love Jossie volume 114\n"
