                "description": "Hi guys, after 1 month of interviewing agencies and freelancers we hired a team. \nBut we are looking for more awesome people (teams) for our cause-based project. \nIt's a performance-based opportunity. If you are not confident in your team's skills, industry competencies, connections and successful team't performance, this opportunity is not for you.\n!!! Please READ carefully and respond to all questions.\nLooking for an NFT marketer to help launch a utility collection and get it sold out.\nWith your bid please describe in details \n1. how much experience do you have with new NFT collections launch / marketing?\n2. how many collections have you launched or helped to launch?\n3. what is the average revenue generated per collection (as a result of your efforts)? (how many NFTs in collection were sold and at what mint price?)\n4. what was your role in these projects? (community manager, moderator, collab manager, collab hunter, other?)\n5. how large is your network of influencers (exact number), NFT investors and collaborators and how will you reach out to them to get 10,000 NFTs sold out (in 3 stages)?\u00a0\u00a0I will generate content, but we need eye balls without paid traffic. How will you accomplish it? What is the size of your email databases?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have your own discord community of investors in early NFT projects you can tap into and offer whitelist seats?\u00a0\u00a0\n6. do you work mainly on Discord?\u00a0\u00a0Twitter?\u00a0\u00a0Reddit?\u00a0\u00a0Instagram? Via email? What would your outreach vehicle be? \n7. have you setup Discord server previously?\u00a0\u00a0If so, for how many projects?\n8. we will need a team of marketing professionals to get the collection sold out. Who do you have on your team who will work on our project (within financial fee of this project, with no additional payment).\n9. does your team has bots and work with them to scale outreaches?\u00a0\u00a0How are you planning to reach 300,000 NFT buyers/investors in 3 months, to build awareness about our project?\u00a0\u00a0And how will you convert them?\n10. please confirm that you agree with the fee structure below (if you don't agree, please don't place your bid !!!), and please specify how exactly you understood it - when your team will be paid and how much?\nHere is how I imagine I can compensate my marketing partner to do the following (tap into collaborators and DAOs, use your existing network by sending emails to your existing database, promote white list giveaway on social and discord, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0It's a performance based compensation.\nIt would be a performance based compensation.\nAt stage 1 on May 1st we release the first 1000 NFTs at around $200, will see (still not sure if Eth or Polygon).\nMarketing can start on Jan 15th, we should have a web site by then. We would have 3.5 months. Then release further parts of the collection in stages.\nCOMPENSATION STRUCTURE &amp; TERMS:\nCompany will pay our Marketing Partner/ Consultant a nominal monthly fee of $100/month (for coffee\u00a0\u00a0:-) ) for the duration of each NFT project launch stage, starting from January 15th (unless other dates specified by the Company as a social media marketing launch date). Each monthly payment will be escrowed and released via Upwork at the end of each month.\nAND... Consultant also will be paid as following:\nFor PHASE 1 Consultant (team) will be paid $3,500 (at the rate $1000 per month AFTER and IF the first 1000 NFTs are fully sold out as a result of Consultants efforts for 3.5 months of work). $3500 will be paid within 7 days AFTER and IF ALL of 1000 NFTs are sold out at price $200 or above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this stage all bots and other automated tools must be free or owned by the Consultant. \nNo paid ads are planned for this project, and only organic strategies must be implemented.\nForPHASE 2 Consultant will be paid additional $6,000 (at the rate $2000 per month AFTER and IF the next 3000 NFTs are fully sold out as a result of Consultants efforts for 2 months of work). $6000 will be paid within 7 days after ALL of 1000 NFTs are sold out at price $200 or above. At this stage you will be given a budget for boosts.\nFor PHASE 3 Consultant will be paid additional $8,000 (at the rate $4000 per month AFTER and IF the next 6000 NFTs are fully sold out as a result of Consultants efforts for 2 months of work). $8000 will be paid within 7 days after ALL of 1000 NFTs are sold out at price $200 or above. At this stage you will be given a budget for boosts and paid ads.\nFor PHASE 4 Consultant will be paid additional $50,000 (at the rate $10,000 per month AFTER and IF the next 20,000 NFTs are fully sold out as a result of Consultants efforts for 5 months of work). $50,000 will be paid within 7 days after ALL of 20,000 NFTs are sold out at the price $100 or above. At this stage you will be given a significant budget for paid ads.\nBONUS: After our NFT collection is fully sold out on all 4 phases, your team will get a bonus of $200,000. \nI welcome your detailed response with your thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease respond to all questions 1 by 1, in detail.",
