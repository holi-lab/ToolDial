            "description": "The papermill alarm is a system which alerts you when a paper is similar to past papermill-products. As such, the output of this API should not be considered to be \u2018evidence\u2019 of misconduct. Instead, the output is alerts which can help you to find cases of misconduct.\n\nThe papermill alarm takes article metadata as input and classifies articles into \u2018red\u2019, \u2018orange\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019.\n\n\u2018red\u2019 means that there are past papermill-papers that are highly similar to the query article.\n\u2018orange\u2019 means that there past papermill-papers that are a little bit similar.\n\u2018green\u2019 means that no similar past papermill-papers are known.\n\nThe purpose of this method is only to show the likelihood of a paper coming from a papermill and it is currently limited to cases in biomedical science where papermills have already produced large numbers of similar papers. \n\n### The following limitations apply:\n\n- in cases where a papermill produces papers that are very different to past papermill-products, this method is not expected to yield a \u2018positive\u2019 result (where \u2018positive\u2019 means that the paper looks like a papermill-product);\n- in cases where an author has produced a paper which happens to be similar to past papermill-products, this method may yield a false-positive.\n\nThis means that the Papermill Alarm should not be used on its own to identify papermills. Detections made with this API do not constitute evidence of misconduct. However, using this API should simplify the process of detecting papermill products in a submission system, or back-archive by highlighting the small proportion of papers which present the most risk.\n\nCurrently, the training data for this application was built by hand using PubMed data. It is therefore unlikely that papermills in fields outside of those covered by PubMed will be detected. However, it is possible to update the API to do this.\n\nIf you have any difficulty using the Papermill Alarm, or would like to see it expanded to work in a domain outside of PubMed, please get in touch via the form at clear-skies.co.uk/contact\n\n### Using the API\n\nThe API runs some resource-intensive deep-learning methods which can be easily overloaded. Resources are scaled up automatically at such times, but it can still cause 504 errors to come back. If you receive a 504 error, please wait 60s before resuming use of the API.\n\nThe API takes a very simple input via a POST request. You may request up to 4 articles at a time. E.g.\n\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://papermill-alarm.p.rapidapi.com/\"\n\npayload = {\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"article_id1\",\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"This is not the title of a papermill paper\",\n\t\t\t\"abstract\": \"This is some text filling space where there should be an abstract.\"\n\t\t}\n\nheaders = {\n\t\"X-RapidAPI-Key\": os.environ.get(\"X-RAPIDAPI-KEY\"),\n\t\"X-RapidAPI-Host\": \"papermill-alarm.p.rapidapi.com\",\n\t\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post( url, \njson=payload, \nheaders=headers\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```",
