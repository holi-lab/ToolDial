    "tool_description": "Submit all your deposits in JSON format. Each deposit has a start date and duration in weeks, days, months or years. Also, set a check date (can be any date or todays date) for when you want to do a maturity check and an alert days duration after check date. This alert days duration is period after the maturity check date that you want to include (says todays date plus 20 days from now).\r\n\r\n It will send back deposits on which you have to take action- those that are maturing before calculated date = check date + alert duration days passed. For each deposit included in response it also send approximate maturing date.\r\n\r\nThe API accepts JSON body and sends response as JSON.\r\n\r\nThis API can be used for investor apps to track when to renew and move the deposits to the right high yield interest generating accounts.",
