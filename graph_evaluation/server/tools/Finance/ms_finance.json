We expect large upward stock moves for Tesla in May as results crushed the Refinitiv EPS consensus of a loss of $0.36. We also expect second quarter will suffer from the firm’s main plant in California being shutdown since late March, but once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, we expect Tesla to fill a large number of orders which are still coming in online. We understand given COVID-19 uncertainty that management cannot give 2020 delivery guidance, but we like that Tesla continues to invest without slowing as evidenced by the Shanghai Model Y plant and Gigafactory Berlin both due to start production next year.",

Even a pandemic causes no fear for the market with this stock, and we're lowering our WACC to about 8.8% from 12%. We're also raising our midcycle operating margin back to 11% and raising deliveries over our 10-year forecast period because we think Tesla will continue to provide formidable competition to premium automakers and have a million units of capacity by the end of 2021. These changes mean we are increasing our fair value estimate to about $731 from $239. If a recession can’t stop Tesla then virtually nothing will, and we expect the company to remain a leader in autonomous technology and range. Tesla is also gaining scale and its ability to make desirable vehicles while generating free cash flow and net profit is far better than it’s ever been. For the quarter, free cash flow was negative $895 million but this was mostly for inventory increases which we expect will become a free cash flow benefit once vehicles being held at the end of first quarter get delivered next quarter.",

By contrast, the Morningstar US Large-Mid Index is down 0.84% in that time. After closing at $923.39 per share on Feb. 16, it still trades above Morningstar's fair value estimate of $700. Since the start of the year, Tesla is down 12.7%, about double the 6.4% decline for the U.S. large-mid index.</p>\n<p>That may not sound like the lawsuit and related issues are affecting the company, but that may change soon as the so-called proxy season unwinds. Shareholders often voice their concerns at corporate annual meetings by voting on management, key business issues, who sits on the board of directors, and proposals by other investors.  </p>\n<p>To be sure, such resolutions are nonbinding, but boards normally pay close attention because shareholders also vote on directors. If the issues described in the lawsuit \"become much more rampant and you see lots of employees speaking up and leaving the company, if Tesla is unable to retain its superstar employees, that could be a problem,\" says Morningstar senior analyst Seth Goldstein, who covers Tesla.</p>\n<p>The New York State Common Retirement Fund is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-15/n-y-pension-ramps-up-pressure-on-tesla-after-race-bias-lawsuit\">proposing a resolution</a> that Tesla publish what it spends on settling discrimination complaints, along with its progress on addressing diversity and inclusion. The company published its first diversity report in 2020.</p>\n<p>Tesla has been the target of numerous complaints about having a work environment hostile to Blacks and women, particularly at its location in Fremont, California, one of its four large global facilities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/04/tesla-discrimination-case/\" target=\"_blank\">A former employee at the site was awarded $137 million in damages last year</a> after a federal jury found that Tesla had subjected the worker to a racially hostile work environment. Tesla asked for a new trial or a lower award. Another former employee won $1 million after an arbitrator found his supervisors at Fremont called him a racial slur and gave him undesirable hours after he complained. The company faces a proposed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-lawsuit-latest-accuse-tesla-discrimination-2022-02-10/\" target=\"_blank\">class-action lawsuit</a> about racism in the workplace as well as several lawsuits by female employees regarding sexual harassment. </p>\n<p>Tesla, in turn, has called the California suit \"<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/dfehs-misguided-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">misguided</a>\" and noted that investigations by the agency over the past five years \"did not find misconduct against\" the company. Tesla didn't respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>“The California lawsuit is another proof point that the issue is a very serious one and we’ll continue to engage,\" says John Streur, chief executive officer of Calvert Research and Management, a sustainable investment firm owned by Morgan Stanley. Last year, a  <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1061914\">resolution proposed by Calvert</span>  won a majority of votes at Tesla's annual meeting. The resolution asked Tesla to provide more data about its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, arguing that increased diversity at the company will help ensure it remains competitive and innovative.</p>\n<p>In a Feb. 15 interview, Streur wouldn't specify the results of Calvert's conversations with Tesla. He did say his objective is \"to strengthen their capacity to create a safe and inclusive work environment for all people and improve the company’s ability to drive value for all stakeholders.\"</p>\n<p>The issues in the California lawsuit are \"a financially material risk factor,\" Streur says. He describes Calvert as a long-term owner, \"almost a permanent investor in some of these companies, so we take a long horizon.\" Employees \"innovate and drive the technology of the products going forward and to really be able to staff and scale globally is critical to the success and for the long-term value of Tesla.\"</p>\n<p>It's a difficult needle to thread because many investors regard Tesla as a solution to the climate crisis, leading the way to net-zero emissions. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest solar panel players in the U.S. Recently, Tesla placed among the top 10 companies in the <a href=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2022/2/15/clean200-outperform-msci-acwi-global-index\" target=\"_blank\">Clean200 list</a> of publicly traded companies that are leading the way to a clean energy future.</p>\n<p>Other long-term investors may also act. Garvin Jabusch, portfolio manager of Green Alpha Advisors, which runs Shelton Green Alpha <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000P7YY\">NEXTX</span>, says he read the complaint at length. \"There's an awful lot of smoke there. I find it hard to believe there wouldn't be some fire.\" Green Alpha has owned Tesla for clients since 2010. </p>\n<p>In the past, Tesla has pushed back with a narrative that punitive regulators, prodded by incumbent automakers, are overreacting to allegations. But this is not what is happening now.</p>\n<p>\"This should never have involved regulators, because Tesla shouldn't have allowed this behavior to exist,\" Jabusch says. The portfolio manager doesn't regard himself as an activist shareholder, but he has asked Tesla for a meeting to discuss the California lawsuit and says that depending on the outcome of the litigation, he may consider divesting or selling his entire position in the shares. </p>\n<p>NIA Impact Capital CEO Kristin Hull says she is planning to move Tesla out of client portfolios into a new \"activist\" portfolio. \"It's too embarrassing\" to hold it in client portfolios after the California lawsuit, Hull says. She made a shareholder proposal last year asking Tesla to report on its use of mandatory arbitration, in which employees must submit to arbitration rather than bring their claims to court. Tesla has been criticized for requiring mandatory arbitration for employee claims of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. The proposal garnered 46.4% of the vote.</p>\n<p>With President Joe Biden to sign into law a bill ending mandatory arbitration for claims of sexual harassment or assault, Hull plans to submit a rewritten proposal that focuses on racial discrimination. </p>\n<p>\"When it comes to ownership on a company that's doing egregious things, we need people who are able to see the long term,\" Hull says. \"When people don't feel comfortable bringing their full selves, Tesla won’t have the innovation that's required.\"  </p>\n<p>Morningstar's Goldstein notes that any settlement \"is really not going to have a huge impact,\" given Tesla's market value of nearly $1 trillion. Still, Goldstein expects \"management and policy changes to ensure these discrimination types of lawsuits don't have to happen again. This could be the likely change for internal policies that hopefully would prevent this from happening to other employees.\" </p></xhtml>",

Large-growth managers for years have grappled with how to manage their funds against an ever-consolidating Russell 1000 Growth Index that, even after retreating in early 2022, remains historically concentrated. </p>\n<p>Using the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA0001B\">IWF</span> as a proxy for the large-cap growth index, at the start of 2014, 21% of the benchmark sat in its top 10 holdings. While some familiar stocks, like Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002HD\">GOOGL</span>, were among the 10 largest index holdings at that time, the top 10 also included traditional defensive stocks like Philip Morris International <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000CUPM\">PM</span>  and Coca-Cola <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001BW\">KO</span>. </p>\n<p>Since then, technology stocks have pushed the index to new heights, as Google (whose parent company is Alphabet), Apple, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000W3KZ\">FB</span>), Microsoft, and Amazon.com <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000B7\">AMZN</span>--the \"GAMMA\" stocks--collectively contributed nearly half of the index's more than 250% gain. </p>\n<p>The rise of the GAMMAs has created a top-heavy index; the top 10 companies are now almost exclusively tech companies and accounted for just under 50% of the Russell 1000 Growth as of January 2022.  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19376.png\"/></p>\n<p>This level of concentration is historically unique, but it is not without fundamental justification. The top 10 companies in the index contributed over 35% of the index's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization over the trailing 12 months through January 2022--a 20-year high. Big tech was a clear beneficiary of the pandemic-inspired work- and shop-from-home trend. Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet each profited massively from the spike in demand for e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing services. In fact, between December 2019 and January 2022, the Russell 1000 Growth--excluding financials, which earn significant interest revenue--added roughly $207 billion in aggregate EBITDA, of which the GAMMAs contributed $196 billion, nearly 95%. Without the GAMMA stocks, the aggregate index barely grew cash earnings at all. Investing, however, is a forward-looking endeavor, and some growth investors are concerned that mega-cap tech companies' big revenue and earnings spikes merely pulled forward future demand, and that their long-term prospects are not as rosy as recent results would indicate.  </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19386.png\"/></p>\n<p>Portfolio holdings data suggest top-rated managers have a cautious attitude toward these companies, though mutual fund regulations also play a role. Within the large-growth Morningstar Category, there are 55 actively managed strategies that earn at least a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Bronze on one of their share classes. Of those 55 strategies, only four were overweight the basket of the index's top 10 companies as of their latest reported portfolios. </p>\n<p>SEC diversification requirements make it hard for most large-growth funds to even hold the GAMMAs at their current market weightings, let alone overweight them. To be considered officially diversified by the SEC, a fund cannot hold more than 5% in a single company in 75% of its portfolio. Forty-one of the 55 active large-growth Morningstar Medalists meet this rule, which essentially means they can make 25% of their portfolios as concentrated as they wish, but after that, the 5% limit kicks in. However, as of January 2022, Apple and Microsoft alone ate up over 23% of the index.</p>\n<p>Holding both at market weights would prevent diversified managers from putting any more than 5% of their assets in any other stock. A diversified manager currently cannot hold the Russell 1000 Growth Index's top three constituents at or above market weights without breaching SEC regulations. This is a big reason why nearly all actively managed large-growth funds are underweight the index's biggest names. This has led some strategies, including T. Rowe Price Growth Stock <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00EJ5\">PRGFX</span>, T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00EI7\">TRBCX</span>, and Vanguard US Growth <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00FU1\">VWUSX</span>, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1033370\">to officially change to \"nondiversified\" mandates</span>, which allows them to get as concentrated as they please. Still, the bulk of large-growth funds are structured to meet the SEC's diversification standard. </p>\n<p>Diversified managers face a real conundrum when it comes to the index's top two stocks, especially. No matter how bullish they are on Apple and Microsoft, they have almost no wiggle room to overweight them. Instead, it leads many of them to bet against the two by owning proportionately less than the index. In fact, all 55 medalist strategies collectively underweight the two stocks. That could hamper these strategies if Apple and Microsoft continue to outperform the broader index and their managers can't find opportunities among relatively smaller companies to make up for the lost ground. This issue affects most large-growth fund owners; of the $1.8 trillion of mutual fund assets in the large-growth category, $1.4 trillion sits in officially diversified mandates. </p>\n<p>Still, there does appear to be legitimate bearish sentiment toward Apple. Only two medalists, American Century Select <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00GS9\">TWSIX</span>  and American Century Ultra <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00JHC\">TWUIX</span>, are overweight Apple, while nearly a third do not even own it. And of the medalists that do own it, their average weighting is less than half the index's. Microsoft has more supporters; almost 90% of medalists own it, though they also keep it at a much smaller average weight than the index. After the top two holdings, the average medalist position in the remaining eight of the top 10 index constituents is generally at or above market weights, although almost half of the medalists avoid Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>, and more than 60% do not own Home Depot <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002OY\">HD</span>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19357.png\"/></p>\n<p>If the index gets more top-heavy, it will force investors in diversified strategies to increase their bets against the top names, no matter what they think of them. This may not be a bad thing; concentration levels rise and fall with the markets, but it is certainly going to be a major factor in how active large-growth managers perform against their passive competitors going forward. </p></xhtml>",

They’re popular names in exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that favor large-growth stocks, too. And they’re both disruptors: Alphabet <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002HD\">GOOGL</span> has changed the way we think about online search (after all, who hasn’t said “I’ll Google it”), while Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>  is leading the charge in taking electric vehicles mainstream.</p>\n<p>We’re pitting these two companies against each other to determine which is the better investment opportunity today based on a few of Morningstar’s proprietary metrics.\n</p>\n<p>As part of this feature, we’re providing access to the full Analyst Reports for both companies to readers for free for a few weeks; Analyst Reports are a part of our paid <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/premium?referid=A4568\">Premium Membership</a>. By using the Analyst Reports for Alphabet and Tesla, you can dig into some of our proprietary metrics more deeply and find out what our analysts have to say about each company’s business strategy, competitive advantages, valuation, and risk. You’ll also have access to similar metrics about close competitors and what the bull and bear cases are for each stock.</p>\n<p>Take a look:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/googl/quote\">Alphabet’s Analyst Report</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/tsla/quote\">Tesla’s Analyst Report</a></p>\n<p>Who wins this stock versus stock cage match? That depends on what Morningstar metrics matter most to you. Let’s run each company through a few of them.\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19344.png\"/><br/>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Price/Fair Value Winner:</strong> Alphabet<br/>\nMorningstar’s analysts calculate a fair value estimate for each stock they cover. The fair value estimate represents the intrinsic value of a stock, based on how much cash we think the company can generate in the future. A stock’s price/fair value is simply its current market price divided by the fair value estimate. A stock trading below 1.0 is undervalued; a stock trading around 1.0 is fairly valued; and a stock trading above 1.0 is overvalued.</p>\n<p>As of this writing, we think Alphabet’s stock is about 25% undervalued, while Tesla’s stock is 23% overvalued. The winner from a price perspective is Alphabet; it is trading at a more attractive price today.</p>\n<p>Watch: <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735361\">The Morningstar Fair Value Estimate</span> </p>\n<p><strong>Uncertainty Winner:</strong> Alphabet<br/>\nMorningstar's uncertainty rating represents the predictability of the company's future cash flows and, therefore, the level of certainty we have in our fair value estimate of a given company. Companies that enjoy sales predictability, modest operating and financial leverage, and limited exposure to contingent events carry low uncertainty; those with less predictable sales, significant leverage, and significant exposure to contingent events carry higher uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Our analysts think Alphabet’s cash flow uncertainty is high--but Tesla’s uncertainty is even higher. Alphabet wins for its relatively lower uncertainty because we’re more confident in our fair value estimate of that stock.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Moat Winner:</strong> Alphabet<br/>\nThe Morningstar Economic Moat Rating represents a company's sustainable competitive advantage. A company with an economic moat can fend off competition and earn high returns on capital for many years to come. A company whose competitive advantages we expect to last more than 20 years has a wide moat, one that can fend off its rivals for 10 years has a narrow moat, while a firm with either no advantage or one that we think will quickly dissipate has no moat.</p>\n<p>Our analysts think Alphabet has carved out a wide economic moat, while Tesla has only built a narrow economic moat. Alphabet for the win on this metric.</p>\n<p>Watch: <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735365\">The Morningstar Economic Moat Rating</span></p>\n<p><strong>Capital Allocation Winner:</strong> Tie<br/>\nThe Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating represents our assessment of how well a company manages its balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions. Analysts assign each company one of three ratings--Exemplary, Standard, or Poor--based on their assessments of how well a management team provides shareholder returns. Adept corporate managers can make a good company even better.</p>\n<p>Both Alphabet and Tesla earn our top rating when it comes to capital allocation.\n</p>\n<p>Watch: <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1013460\">Introducing the Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating</span></p>\n<p><strong>Overall Winner:</strong> Alphabet<br/>\nAt the end of the day, the “winner” of any cage match from Morningstar’s perspective is the stock that’s trading at the largest discount to our fair value estimate after being adjusted for uncertainty. The Morningstar Rating for stocks encapsulates just that. Stocks rated 4 and 5 stars are undervalued after being adjusted for uncertainty, stocks rated 3 stars are fairly valued, and stocks rated 1 or 2 stars are overvalued after being adjusted for uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Alphabet earns a 4-star rating as of this writing, while Tesla earns a 2-star rating. Alphabet is the much better value today from Morningstar’s perspective.</p>\n<p><em>Watch: <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735356\">The Morningstar Rating for Stocks</span> </em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/premium?referid=A4568\">Start your free 14-day trial of Morningstar Premium</a><em>.

You may well ask, because flows into sustainable funds have helped drive these names higher, and they’re likely to stay on the radar as the corporate world adopts more environmentally friendly and other sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>One is Xylem <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000UDG9\">XYL</span>, the water technology company spun out by ITT in 2011, that treats and tests water for utilities, and industrial and residential customers. It has “consistently outearned its cost of capital,” with about half its revenue recurring, according to Morningstar analyst Krzysztof Smalec.</p>\n<p>Another is Ecolab <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001V4\">ECL</span>, which provides cleaning and sanitizing services for a variety of industries--you might have seen its hand sanitizer dispensers in an office lobby--as well as wastewater treatment and other services. By making water use more efficient, it saves on energy costs, too. One fan is Bill Gates, who owns it through his Cascade Investment vehicle. </p>\n<p>Those are just a couple of the names on a list provided by Sara Mahaffy, the environmental, social, and governance strategist at RBC Capital. Mahaffy regularly runs a screen of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are the most widely held by actively managed sustainable funds, or funds that follow ESG principles, either to reduce risk or to achieve certain outcomes.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Mahaffy looks for the 20 or so names that are in the top 10% of ownership by actively managed sustainable funds, but not in the top 10% of ownership by conventional, long-only big-cap stock funds and hedge funds. You can see the results in Exhibit 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit 1</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19332.png\"/></p>\n<p>Both Xylem and Ecolab are water-related companies. So is no. 4, American Water Works <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00009JO7\">AWK</span>, the largest investor-owned U.S. water and wastewater utility, as water use, cleanliness, and efficiency are increasingly important.</p>\n<p>Other names on the list include Aptiv <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000UNII\">APTV</span>, which sells software that powers electric and self-driving vehicles; Agilent Technologies <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000007E\">A</span>, which supplies lab tools for life sciences, chemicals, and other industries; and Autodesk <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000LM\">ADSK</span>, which makes software for construction, engineering, and other industries. </p>\n<p>Mahaffy rebalances the list every quarter. These names are from the third quarter of 2021. What fell off the list? American Tower <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000ED\">AMT</span> and Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>, which “barely missed” being on the list, simply because of the popularity of the names above them. </p>\n<p>Why is this list so interesting? They are beneficiaries of the <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076648\">growing inflows into ESG funds</span>, and shed light into the themes that are attracting capital as companies refashion themselves to become more sustainable, reshaping the market.</p>\n<p>Many of the names are high quality, with economic moats, or a strong ability to keep competitors at bay over time, as well as low sustainability risk. Indeed, seven appear on Morningstar’s own list of <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074326\">top sustainable companies to own</span>, including Agilent, Autodesk, financial software giant Intuit <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00000300\">INTU</span>, waste disposal and recycling outfit Waste Management <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000005V2\">WM</span>, animal health specialist Zoetis <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000XYO2\">ZTS</span>, biotech company Amgen <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000F0\">AMGN</span>, and lab equipment supplier Waters <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000005V9\">WAT</span>. </p>\n<p>Mahaffy notes that the basket of stocks outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 “generally” in recent years, trouncing the index in 2020 in particular. (You can see the degree of outperformance in the exhibit). Nevertheless, it has moments of weakness. This year through Feb. 2, the basket lagged the S&amp;P 500 by 6%.</p>\n<p>That’s creating some interesting opportunities, says Mahaffy. In July, the valuation of the basket was more than double that of the S&amp;P 500. That’s dropped back to about 1.5 times. “They’re trading right around where they stabilized in early 2021,” she says.<br/>\nThe RBC strategist won’t recommend particular names, but on a valuation basis, a handful are trading below Morningstar’s fair value estimate, including:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    Ecolab: The 4-star name trades at a discount to Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein’s fair value estimate of $215 a share after the company recently missed its own earnings and revenue guidance amid supply chain disruptions. </li>\n    <li>\n    Linde <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000004FA\">LIN</span>: A 3-star industrial gas producer that’s developing carbon capture technologies and using green hydrogen in chipmaking, and which also trades below Smalec’s fair value estimate of $316. </li>\n    <li>\n    Starbucks <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00000546\">SBUX</span>: The world’s largest specialty coffee chain, it trades below analyst Sean Dunlop’s fair value estimate of $106. </li>\n    <li>Intel <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002X8\">INTC</span>: The chipmaker also trades under analyst Abhinav Davuluri’s fair value estimate of $65. </li>\n    <li>\n    Amgen trades just below analyst Karen Andersen’s fair value estimate of $260 a share. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the market continues to languish, expect that even more names may be worth another look.</p></xhtml>",

Nearly half of the underlying stocks in the Morningstar U.S. Market Index--including widely held names such as Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>, Nvidia <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003RE\">NVDA</span>, Meta Platforms <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000W3KZ\">FB</span>  (formerly Facebook), and Netflix <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003UP\">NFLX</span>--are now down 20% or more from their 52-week highs. While broader market benchmarks have been more resilient, growth stocks have officially dipped into correction territory: The Morningstar Small, Mid, and Large Growth indexes were all down about 17% for the year to date through Feb. 3, 2022.</p>\n<p>Although the year is off to <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076995\">a more volatile</span>  than usual start, the recent market jitters aren’t completely unheard of. In this article, I’ll look at current market volatility relative to previous norms and suggest some ways for investors to cope.</p>\n<strong>How Bad Is the Current Market?</strong>\n<p> As the chart below shows, volatility has been on an upward trend. The CBOE VIX index, which measures market expectations for equity-market volatility based on index options for the S&amp;P 500, has trended up after a relatively quiet summer. Markets have been shaken by a few different things: ongoing worries about new coronavirus variants, political instability in Eastern Europe, the sudden <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076690\">resurgence of inflation</span>, and fears that <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1077948\">rising interest rates</span>  could put a damper on future equity valuations. As a result, the VIX has recently spiked into the high 20s, compared with a long-term average of about 19.3.\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19263.png\"/>\n</p>\n<p>Actual volatility has also increased. After an unusually quiet year during most of 2021, the standard deviation for the Morningstar U.S. Market Index has also started trending higher. The standard deviation stood at 13.2% for the trailing 12-month period through Jan. 31, 2022, compared with 10.77% for calendar 2021. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19264.png\"/>\n</p>\n<p>This volatility has also translated into more frequent losses. Since the market started getting more jittery in November 2021, about half of all trading days have closed with market losses. The number of trading days with losses of 1% or more has also increased slightly. </p>\n<strong>It’s All Relative</strong>\n<p>When looked at in the context of longer-term historical averages, though, recent market performance hasn’t been that far outside the norm. As the table below illustrates, market losses are actually pretty common. About 45% of trading days finish with negative returns. Losses are less frequent with longer periods, but still relatively common. About 42% of weekly trading periods have historically ended with negative returns, and about a third of all monthly trading periods have finished up in the red. Over longer periods, annual returns have been negative about one fourth of the time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19265.png\"/></p>\n<p><em>Note: Daily, weekly, and monthly figures are based on total returns for the Morningstar U.S. Market Index starting in 1992. Annual figures are based on total returns for the IA SBBI Large Stock Index starting in 1926.</em></p>\n<p>Recent market volatility hasn’t been too far outside the usual range. Since November 2021, there have been 34 trading days with negative returns, but only two of those days have closed with losses greater than 2%. Volatility probably seems higher partly because we’ve experienced some more-dramatic intraday swings; in addition, growth stocks have suffered much more frequent and severe losses.</p>\n<p>Some investors might also be alarmed by recent market turmoil simply because we haven’t seen much of it in the recent past. The novel coronavirus-driven bear market in early 2020 was unusually swift and severe but also surprisingly short-lived. After dropping about 34% from Feb. 19 through March 23, 2020, stocks surged ahead to make a full recovery by August.</p>\n<p>After the 2020 rebound, 2021 proved to be another temperate year for equity investors. Market volatility was well below average, with a standard deviation about 20% below the long-term historical average for the year. With a few exceptions (such as the tech, media, and telecom correction that started in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and pandemic-driven uncertainty in early 2020), market volatility was also generally below average over the three previous decades. </p>\n<p>Based on past history, periodic market downturns are entirely normal and to be expected. Over longer time periods, the market tends to be self-correcting; certain areas may get frothy and reach bubble status, and overall market valuations may overshoot the mark, but periodic downturns are a way of correcting for the excess. Heading into 2022, the overall market was trading at a 5% premium to the aggregate fair value estimated by Morningstar’s equity analysts. After the recent drop, valuations are now looking more reasonable. </p>\n<strong>Why the Road Ahead Might Remain Bumpy</strong>\n<p>While valuation risk looks like less of an issue, there’s no guarantee that market turmoil will settle down in the short term. It’s a cliche to say that we’re living in unprecedented times, but we really are in a period of flux and regime change. The previous 30 years (1991-2020) were generally marked by declining interest rates and benign inflation, creating a favorable environment for both stocks and bonds. But both measures are now reversing course. After running well below average for several years, inflation has recently been running at a 7% annualized rate, its highest level in the past 40 years. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it expects to begin raising interest rates later this year to keep inflation under control, and yields on the 10-year Treasury have already edged up in response. </p>\n<p>A fundamental regime change for both interest rates and inflation would have far-reaching implications for many asset classes, and it could take a while for the market to adapt to conditions that are far different from what most investors have grown up with. Indeed, many previously long-running trends have already made dramatic reversals over the past several months. Market leadership has flipped from growth to value; from tech stocks to energy, commodities, and other sectors; and from momentum names to tamer factors such as value, yield, and low volatility. And as both stocks and bonds have slid, the previously stalwart 60/40 portfolio has recently captured more of the downside than we’ve been accustomed to in recent decades.</p>\n<strong>What It Means for Your Portfolio</strong>\n<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that, while market turmoil can be unpleasant, it ultimately doesn’t matter too much for most long-term investors. (<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1048704\">Sequence of returns</span>  risk is the exception, because an adverse sequence of returns puts retirees at risk of depleting their portfolios early in retirement and later missing out on an eventual rebound.) Far greater is the risk of permanent capital loss, or the risk of not meeting your long-term financial goals.</p>\n<p>As Christine Benz covered in a <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076068\">recent article</span>, investors unsettled by market turbulence might want to take as step back to see whether their original investment plans still make sense. If you’re approaching retirement, for example, you might need to de-risk your portfolio to mitigate the risk of starting to make withdrawals during an adverse sequence of returns. If you’ll need to tap into your portfolio within the few years (to pay for bigger expenses such as a down payment or upcoming college tuition) or if you’re tempted to sell if things get worse, those can also be legitimate reasons to reconsider your portfolio’s asset mix. </p>\n<p>But if your portfolio’s asset mix is still a good fit for your time horizon and ability to take on risk, it’s best to tune out the noise and avoid making any major changes: Keep calm and carry on.</p></xhtml>",

In my <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/collections/172/our-picks\">Our Picks</a> column this week, I took a look at <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1077104\">four stocks trading well above what we think they’re worth</span>. My colleague Dave Sekera examined <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076129\">overvalued mega-cap stocks</span>, too--Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>  and Apple <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000GY\">AAPL</span>  are just two of the 12 familiar names on Dave’s list.</p>\n<h2>Bond Funds to Consider</h2>\n<p>Bonds didn’t have anything brag about in January. Every major bond-fund Morningstar Category (except bank loans) posted losses last month, and funds that held bonds sensitive to interest-rate changes fared the worst. “Lately, there’s been virtually no place for bond investors to hide,” observed my colleague <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/search?query=katherine%20lynch\">Katherine Lynch</a> in her comprehensive recap, \"<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076966\">Bond Funds Start 2022 in a Sea of Red</span>.\"</p>\n<p>I asked <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/30/christine-benz\">Christine Benz</a>, Morningstar’s director of personal finance and retirement planning, how investors should be thinking about bonds these days. Her reply: “Because of their low-starting yields, bond funds are unlikely to have great returns over the next decade, and they may experience some short-term losses as interest rates move up. But high-quality bond funds are still likely to hold their ground pretty well in a big equity market shock. That means that holding assets in cash and bonds is essential for anyone who’s getting close to drawing upon their portfolios for living expenses, such as retirees.” </p>\n<p>Those looking to add some bonds to their portfolios can find some new ideas in \"<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076683\">The Best Active ETFs for 2022 and Beyond</span>,\" which analyst <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2335/mike-mulach\">Mike Mulach</a> published earlier this week. You can find more of our highest-rated fixed-income choices in \"<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1004377\">The Best Taxable-Bond Funds</span>.\" </p>\n<h2>It’s Tax Season!</h2>\n<p>I’m not actually as excited about tax season as the exclamation point above might suggest. But Christine Benz says that, yes, doing tax work should be on our <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1072684\">February financial to-do lists</span>. Pulling together all of our paperwork--virtual or otherwise--is only one part of the process, says Christine. While you’re at it, use your tax documents to gauge your financial health, too: “So, for example, if you've gotten your W-2 recently, and you also were lucky enough to get a raise last year, look at whether you are funding your 401(k) to the maximum extent that you can swing. Look at your health savings account contributions. If you're able to make an HSA and you're covered by a qualifying high-deductible healthcare plan, are you taking advantage of those HSA contributions to the extent that you possibly can?”</p>\n<p>Read on to find out <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"790381\">what you can learn from your 1099 form</span>, and watch Christine’s <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076725\">February financial to-dos video</span>.</p>\n<h2>Stock of the Week: Alphabet</h2>\n<p>Alphabet blew the roof off with its fourth-quarter results, thanks to growth in search advertising and Google cloud, as well as further YouTube monetization. And strong revenue created operating leverage that widened margins more than expected, explained Morningstar analyst <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2027/ali-mogharabi\">Ali Mogharabi</a>. “While we expect slower revenue growth this year, we project double-digit growth in YouTube and cloud to continue,” Ali noted in his <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1077229\">analyst update on the stock</span>. We boosted our <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735361\">fair value estimate</span>  to $3,600, and shares look undervalued as of this writing.</p>\n<p>Alphabet also announced that it plans to do a 20-for-1 stock split in July. My colleague <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2236/ruth-saldanha\">Ruth Saldanha</a> wrote a terrific piece this week about <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"998572\">what stock splits are</span> and how the Alphabet stock split will work.

The Morningstar Global Markets Index--a broad gauge of global equities--followed last year's 17.8% return in 2021 with a 5.2% slide last month. That was the benchmark's worst monthly showing since its pandemic-fueled 14.2% drawdown in March 2020. Bonds offered no shelter. The Morningstar US Core Bond Index retreated 2.1% in January, its worst month since November 2016.</p>\n<p>Investors in U.S. exchange-traded funds took note. ETFs collected $36.3 billion of new money in January, which would have ranked as the lowest monthly total of 2021. Fixed-income ETFs surrendered $5.9 billion to withdrawals--their first month of outflows since March 2020. </p>\n<p>Here, we'll take a closer look at how the major asset classes performed last month, where investors put their money, and which corners of the market looked rich and undervalued at month's end, all through the lens of ETFs.</p>\n<h2>Reversing Course</h2>\n<p>Exhibit 1 shows the January returns for a sample of ETFs rated by Morningstar analysts that serve as proxies for major asset classes. Investors in a blended global portfolio lost 3.44% last month. Vanguard Total World Stock ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06UUJ\">VT</span>, which constitutes the stock sleeve and powered the portfolio forward in 2021, shed 4.58% last month. The portfolio's fixed-income allocation fared better but still lost value in January. Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06C1Y\">BND</span>  and Vanguard Total International Bond ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000NBIM\">BNDX</span>  lost 2.06% and 1.38%, respectively. These funds have historically shown little correlation with VT, but that doesn't mean they will always shoulder the load when stocks slump. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19204.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 1277px;\"/></p>\n<p>International stocks held up a bit better than their domestic brethren last month. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF's <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000LVTA\">VXUS</span> 2.38% slide was enough to beat U.S.-focused Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA0002P\">VTI</span>  for the first time since last May. </p>\n<p>Emerging-markets stocks helped the cause. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000OPJJ\">IEMG</span>  limited its dip to 0.47% last month. Resilient performance from stocks in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa--which IEMG weights about 3 times as heavily as VXUS does--helped the fund stay afloat. IEMG traded at a 19% discount at January's end, according to Morningstar's <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"944012\">fair value estimates</span>  for the stocks in its portfolio. The fund finished last year in the red while its developed-market twin iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000OPP5\">IEFA</span>  cruised to an 11.29% return, but IEMG took the early lead this year. </p>\n<p>U.S. stocks did not carry their momentum from 2021 into the new year. IShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04ACM\">ITOT</span>  was down as much as 10.23% before a two-day rally at the end of the month sealed a 5.93% loss for January. The promise of interest-rate hikes likely drove the swift sell-off. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell crystallized plans to increase interest rates in March--the first of what appears to be a series of bumps throughout the year. March should also conclude the Fed's asset purchasing program, which has infused cash into the economy since the onset of the pandemic. </p>\n<p>Growth stocks bore the brunt of the interest-rate news. Since these companies' anticipated cash flows are further in the future than their value peers', they are hit harder when interest rates increase. Indeed, Vanguard Growth ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04AC5\">VUG</span>  slid 9.41% last month. Its value twin, Vanguard Value ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04AC4\">VTV</span>, peeled back 1.07%. </p>\n<p>The interest-rate-inflicted pain was acute for consumer discretionary and tech stocks, two of the market's most richly valued sectors. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA00008\">XLY</span>  lost 9.53% in January, as key holdings Amazon.com <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000B7\">AMZN</span>, Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>, and Nike <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003X1\">NKE</span>  lost between 10% and 12% apiece. In the tech arena, semiconductor manufacturers Nvidia <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003RE\">NVDA</span>  and Advanced Micro Devices <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000006A\">AMD</span>  both fell over 15% after excelling in 2021. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, some steadier market elders weathered the broad pullback well. Consumer staples stalwarts Coca-Cola <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001BW\">KO</span>, Altria Group <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000AV\">MO</span>, and General Mills <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002DT\">GIS</span>  all finished January with positive returns. These firms' steady hands helped VTV minimize its decline. Last month's real winner, however, was 2021's best-performing sector: energy. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA00009\">XLE</span>  notched a standout 18.77% return in January, which exceeded the next-closest sector ETF, Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA0000A\">XLF</span>, by more than 18 percentage points. Left for dead in the spring of 2020, firms like Exxon Mobil <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00000220\">XOM</span>  and Occidental Petroleum <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00000412\">OXY</span>  have rebounded as energy prices have reached their highest levels in years.</p>\n<p>Sector constraints prevented iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000PGP4\">VLUE</span>  from fully channeling energy stocks' success, but its 1.97% January dip still led iShares' suite of single-factor strategic-beta funds. IShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Factor ETF's <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000M8DC\">USMV</span>  5.98% slide last month continued a troubling pattern: USMV trailed the S&amp;P 500 in each of the past five months that the broad benchmark finished in the red. From the start of 2020 through January 2022, the fund captured 99% of the S&amp;P 500's downside but only 73% of its upside. This serves as an important reminder for investors looking to dial back risk: Low-volatility stocks are still stocks, and there is no substitute for curbing risk with a more conservative asset allocation.</p>\n<h2>A Tough Act to Follow </h2>\n<p>Investors dipped their toes into ETF waters in January after last year's $902 billion of inflows. Stock ETFs, which set a fresh annual flows record by last July, collected $32.8 billion of new money last month. That represented about three fourths of all January inflows. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19205.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 447px;\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19206.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 631px;\"/></p>\n<p>It's no surprise to see stock ETFs lead the way, but large-growth and large-blend funds' January outflows marked a turnaround from last year. Those two Morningstar Categories ranked first and fifth in 2021 inflows, respectively, with large-blend funds alone accounting for nearly one fourth of all ETF flows.</p>\n<p>Flows into value and growth funds followed relative performance in January, which continues a trend that persisted in 2021. U.S. value funds collectively reeled in nearly $17 billion of new money last month, with U.S. large-value ETFs leading all Morningstar Categories. Growth funds bled nearly $13 billion. Performance between value and growth stocks was fairly even in 2021. Time will tell if last month was a harbinger for a sustained value comeback--and perhaps the flows that follow--but investors seemed to bet on it in January.</p>\n<p>Sector ETF flows reflected investors' appetite for potentially undervalued corners of the market as well. Funds that invest in financial stocks--mainstays of most value index funds--added $5.0 billion in January. Consumer defensive and utilities ETFs saw lucrative months as well, as they hauled in $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, investors rotated out of faster-growing sectors. Technology, consumer discretionary, and communication-services ETFs collectively leaked $5.2 billion last month after absorbing $19.6 billion last year. While these pivots may have worked in investors' favor in January, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076735\">it can be difficult to effectively use sector funds over the long run</span>. </p>\n<p>Fixed-income funds bled $5.9 billion in January in their first month of outflows since $20.7 billion flooded out in March 2020. High-yield bond funds suffered the worst of it. Their $6.7 billion January outflow ranked second-most among all categories. These funds hold risky debt that tends to be more closely correlated with the ebbs and flows of the stock market, so it makes sense that a rocky month for equities accompanied their outflows. Corporate-bond ETFs, which also tend to exhibit more stocklike performance than better-diversified bond portfolios, parted with $1.8 billion last month. </p>\n<p>Inflation-protected bond funds lost steam in January as well. Their $368 million outflow snapped a monthly inflow streak that started in April 2020 and underpinned a record-setting 2021. As the Fed starts to make more concrete strides to dial back inflation, it seems that investors' enthusiasm for these offerings has waned.</p>\n<p>After finishing 2021 as the only broad category group to see outflows for the year, commodities funds bounced back, posting their largest inflows since May 2020. SPDR Gold Shares ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04AD2\">GLD</span>  saw the most pronounced turnaround. It welcomed $2.5 of fresh money last month after surrendering $10.7 billion last year, which ranked second-most among all ETFs. Gold, often heralded as safe-haven asset, tends to attract investment during times of turmoil. It was not immune from January's tribulations, however; GLD sunk 1.68% last month. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19207.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 1009px;\"/></p>\n<h2>Vanguard Rights the Ship</h2>\n<p>Vanguard dominated the ETF provider flows leaderboard in January after conceding the top spot to iShares in the final two months of 2021. The $22.1 billion it brought in last month accounted for nearly half of all ETF inflows. </p>\n<p>Vanguard's clientele tend to be long-term investors who are inclined to leave their money alone during volatile markets. More-tactical investors tend to favor offerings from iShares and State Street, both of which endured net outflows last month. IShares' lineup of fixed-income products is mostly to blame for the firm's first month of outflows since March 2020. IShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06BYT\">HYG</span>  and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA0003A\">TLT</span>  leaked over $3.0 billion each. IShares TIPS Bond ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04ABZ\">TIP</span>, one of its most lucrative funds last year, parted with $2.3 billion. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19208.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 521px;\"/></p>\n<p>Dimensional Fund Advisors narrowly missed the top-10 cut as flows into its ETF lineup have gained momentum. Somewhat late to the ETF party, the systematic investing shop launched its first two ETFs in January 2020. Two years later, it offers 13 such products that collectively count $44.7 billion in assets. DFA U.S. Core Equity 2 ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F0000162EB\">DFAC</span>, the largest of the bunch, led the way with $307 million of inflows in January. Should the market consistently reward the value factor--a core tenet of the firm's investment philosophy--DFA may find itself cracking the top-10 ETF provider list soon.</p>\n<h2>Drug and Digital-Asset ETFs Look Cheap  </h2>\n<p>The fair value estimate for ETFs rolls up our equity analysts' fair value estimates for individual stocks and our quantitative fair value estimates for stocks not covered by Morningstar analysts into an aggregate fair value estimate for stock ETF portfolios. Dividing an ETF's market price by this value yields its price/fair value ratio. This ratio can point to potential bargains and areas of the market where valuations are stretched.</p>\n<p>ETFs that aim to leverage the legalization of cannabis or other drugs dominated the cheaper half of Exhibit 6, which features funds that traded at the lowest prices relative to their fair value at January's end. Turbulence from 2021 spilled into the new year for these funds. Global X Cannabis ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F000013QCG\">POTX</span>  lost 12.53% after shedding 39.3% of its value last year, for example. However, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074292\">as Morningstar's Kris Inton explains</span>, better days may lie ahead for beaten-down cannabis companies. </p>\n<p>A trio of crypto-centric ETFs found themselves at the cheaper end of Exhibit 6 as well. Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining &amp; Semiconductor ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F000016TEV\">RIGZ</span>, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F0000178FC\">SATO</span>, and Global X Blockchain ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F000016SOI\">BKCH</span>  invest in companies whose operations center around digital assets or the underlying technology. Each fund hit the market shortly after bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies took off in early 2021. They have seen shoddy results. BKCH has shed 31.15% since its launch last July, for example. While these funds should benefit if cryptocurrencies return to their early 2021 form, their early tribulations illustrate the risk that comes with trendy thematic ETFs. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19209.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 1069px;\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19210.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 1047px;\"/></p>\n<p>When Ark Innovation ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000ZGOB\">ARKK</span>  manager <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1075205\">Cathie Wood claimed in January that the fund's holdings were trading in deep-value territory</span>, she was met with widespread skepticism. But after a sparkling 2020, the fund shed 44.7% over the past 12 months. At the end of January, the fund that once inhabited the pricier side of Exhibit 7 traded at a 41% discount to its fair value.</p>\n<p>Vanguard Real Estate ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04ACZ\">VNQ</span>  ranked as one of the most richly valued funds at January's close. This fund earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold because it accurately represents the U.S. real estate market at a low cost, which implies that real estate stocks may be holistically overvalued. This seems a surprise, as their weight in the Russell 1000 Value Index (5.1%) nearly tripled that of the Russell 1000 Growth (1.8%). Real estate securities tend to have asset-heavy balance sheets that condense their price/book ratios, a key component in the Russell indexes' style definition. Even value index funds can be stuck with relatively rich constituents at times.</p>\n<p>T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F000014K9K\">TDVG</span>  may be one of the more attractive names on the pricier side of Exhibit 7. A proven manager and patient, dividend-focused approach earn this fund a Silver rating. The fund's focus on financially healthy firms that are poised to steadily increase dividends sticks out next to its growth-at-all-costs comrades in Exhibit 7. It mostly outperformed such funds in January, which may have helped it ascend the price/fair value list.</p></xhtml>",

                        "Body":"<xhtml xmlns=\"http://cms.morningstar.com/api/v2\"><p>On Tuesday, February 1, Alphabet <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002HD\">GOOGL</span>, the parent company of search engine Google, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1077229\">announced plans</span>  for a 20-for-1 stock split. That means for each share of Alphabet you own, you'd get 19 additional shares. This isn't the first time an investor darling has split its stock. Back in 2020, both Apple <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000GY\">AAPL</span>  and Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>  announced stock splits. Apple announced a 4-for-1 split, while Tesla announced a 5-for-1 split. Alphabet itself has split before--in a 2-for-1 split in 2014. </p>\n<p>What does that mean, though?</p>\n<p><strong>Just Math<br/>\n</strong>Simply put, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share gets divided, or split, into multiple shares. Don’t worry, though. The value of your holdings is the same, just in smaller chunks.</p>\n<p>Think about it like a dark chocolate bar. Your one big dark chocolate bar is broken down into multiple bite-size pieces. You still have the same amount of chocolate, just in smaller segments.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in a stock split, it is very important to remember that the price of the share also is reduced. For example, if a company board announces a 2-for-1 split, then you get one extra share for each share you own--but the share price will be halved. In this example of a 2-for-1 split, if you had one share of Company X at $10 per share, you now have two shares of Company X at $5 per share.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that the stock has become cheaper. The fundamentals of the company and the stock price have not changed. Sticking with the dark chocolate bar analogy, after breaking the bar into smaller bits, you have smaller bits of dark chocolate, not more chocolate overall.</p>\n<p><strong>But Why?<br/>\n</strong>Why do companies announce stock splits? Stock splits are a way for companies to increase their overall liquidity.</p>\n<p>Liquidity means the ease with which investors can buy or sell shares on a stock exchange. The smaller the dollar amount of each share, the smaller number of shares are needed by even the smallest investor to buy or sell that stock.</p>\n<p>In most cases, stock splits are undertaken by companies when the share price has gone up significantly, particularly in relation to a company’s stock market peers. If the share price becomes more affordable for smaller investors, it can reasonably be assumed that more investors will participate, and so the overall liquidity of the stock would increase as well.</p>\n<p>But remember this with stock splits: Though the number of outstanding shares changes, and though the price of each share changes, the company's overall market capitalization stays the same. The value of the company doesn’t increase when a split occurs, therefore the value of your stocks, your shares, doesn’t change, either.</p>\n<p>Take Alphabet for example. It closed Tuesday, February 1, at $2,572.88. Many investors (myself included) would not be able to invest in Alphabet, because I do not have $2500-odd to invest in one share of one company. Now if the stock split were to happen as of Tuesday’s close, the cost of each share would go from $2,572.88 to $128.64, and each existing holder would get 19 additional shares for every share they own. A stock price of $128-odd would be much more manageable, both for me and for many others.</p>\n<p>This is especially true now with more and more investors having access to low-cost trading platforms. Buying and selling stocks is now easier than ever, and for many investors these recent splits might be an entry point into companies they have long admired.</p>\n<p>All this being said, these recent high-profile splits seem superfluous given that most brokerage platforms now enable trading in fractional shares. Perhaps the psychology of owning at least one whole share is at play in the companies’ decisions.</p>\n<p>“When we look at a company like Apple and strictly observe the value of an investment immediately after a stock split, there really isn’t a discernable pattern in the change in wealth. What is noticeable is the trading volume of the stock which might be attributed to news flow. All this said, for long-term investors in a stock, a stock split (or reverse split) really doesn’t affect the fundamental value of the company or the wealth in your pocket,” points out Morningstar Canada’s director of Investment Research Ian Tam.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Company Change?</strong><br/>\nNot at all. Stock splits do not alter the fundamentals of the company in any way, apart from the short-term price increases we described earlier. There’s no harm done in this regard if the stock doesn’t split either.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Upside Down</strong><br/>\nThe opposite of a stock split is a reverse stock split.</p>\n<p>In the case of reverse stock splits, the company divides the number of shares that investors own, rather than multiplying them. As a result, the price of the shares increases.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you own 10 shares of Company X at $10 per share, and the company announces a 1-for-2 reverse stock split, you end up owning five shares of Company X at $20 per share. Usually, reverse stock splits are announced by companies that have low share prices and want to increase them--oftentimes to avoid being delisted. </p>\n<p>You may think that reverse stock splits are bad news for the company, but this is not always the case. One of the most famous examples of reverse stock splits is Citigroup <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001A2\">C</span>. Its share price declined to under $10 during the 2008 global financial crisis and stayed there, so in 2011 the Citigroup board decided to do a reverse split of 1-for-10. The split took the price from $4.50 per share to $45 per share. The company--and the stock--survived and is now trading at around $65 per share.</p>\n<p>See, just math!</p></xhtml>",

Some of the index's most heavily weighted constituents--including Microsoft <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003MH\">MSFT</span>, Amazon <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000B7\">AMZN</span> and Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>--lost even more than that.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, January turned out to be a great time to pick up some solid companies at good prices. In fact, the sell-off pushed the stocks of several high-quality firms with wide <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735365\">economic moats</span> into <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1075973\">bargain territory</span>.</p>\n<p>Yet despite the rough-and-tumble start to the new year, many stocks still look overpriced to us, based on our <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735361\">fair value estimates</span>. Here’s a closer look at four stocks trading well above what we think they’re worth. Given their price risk, they’re stocks to avoid today.</p>\n<h2>Allscripts Healthcare Solutions <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000A2\">MDRX</span> <br/>\nMorningstar Fair Value Estimate: $10.90<br/>\nStock price (as of 1/31/22 close): $20.22<br/>\nPrice/Fair Value: 1.86</h2>\n<p>“Following our coverage refresh of Allscripts, we see the company’s shares as highly overvalued, trading at a 60% premium to our fair value estimate of $10.90. Ultimately, our unfavorable outlook on the company reflects its undifferentiated offering, the erosion of its client base to rivals (primarily Epic), and exogenous market trends leading toward consolidation of its core physician office clients by larger integrated delivery networks). We maintain our no-moat rating and negative moat trend assessment for the company.</p>\n<p>\"Allscripts’ core offering is its suite of electronic health record solutions: the electronic records of a patient’s medical history. In the acute hospital space, Allscripts’ market share significantly lags competitors Epic and Cerner, which combined represent a majority of the market. The EHR market is highly mature, and the technology is ubiquitous across medical care settings--early movers like Epic and Cerner have been the primary beneficiary of the industry boon following the introduction of federal subsidies (Hitech Act of 2009) and overall trends toward digitization over the past decade and a half. The remaining opportunity--the replacement market--has largely skipped over Allscripts, with privately held Epic’s best-of-breed EHR platform dominating the market for larger hospitals and health networks, and Cerner having won a $16 billion contract to upgrade federal (Department of Veteran Affairs) hospitals through 2028. Additionally, while Allscripts’ Veradigm business segment--a catchall for its data offerings--has exhibited stronger growth and relatively higher margins, we fail to see any meaningful differentiation over Epic and Cerner’s own nascent data offerings.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2253/dylan-finley\">Dylan Finley</a>, analyst</em></p>\n<h2>Lululemon Athletica <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00009C0X\">LULU</span> <br/>\nMorningstar Fair Value Estimate: $193.00<br/>\nStock price (as of 1/31/22 close): $333.76<br/>\nPrice/Fair Value: 1.73</h2>\n<p>“Citing challenges due to the recent COVID-19 resurgence, including supply problems, labor shortages, and reduced store hours, narrow-moat Lululemon preannounced sales and EPS expectations for 2021’s fourth quarter at the low end of prior guidance of sales of $2.125 billion-$2.165 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.25-$3.32. We were anticipating adjusted EPS of $3.31 on sales of $2.162 billion. Lululemon’s share price dropped by a mid-single-digit percentage on the news and has now fallen about 30% from its all-time high in November. Even so, we still view it as significantly overvalued in relation to our fair value estimate of $193. Although one mild earnings miss does not materially affect our valuation, we have long had concerns that it is priced to perfection in a very competitive industry. Moreover, in the short term, it appears the COVID-19 effects could linger well into 2022 as there are new restrictions in some areas and there are reports of factory shutdowns in Asia. We expect to update our estimates after Lululemon reports its full results in March. As a corporate-tax hike in the U.S. now appears unlikely, this update will include a reduction in our long-term tax rate assumption that could lift our fair value estimate by a mid-single-digit percentage.</p>\n<p>\"Lululemon has consistently smashed sales and earnings expectations over the past three years, so it is surprising to see any sort of weakness, especially as no-moat competitor Dick’s Sporting Goods <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001PL\">DKS</span>  preannounced solid holiday 2021 results. Although we continue to view the Lululemon brand, the source of our narrow-moat rating, as strong, we have concerns that the massive amount of low-priced competition is beginning to have some impact. Dick’s, for example, seems to be having success with its reasonably priced private-label activewear, while massively growing Chinese fast fashion firm Shein markets leggings and other items at prices that a U.S. producer could never match.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2243/david-swartz\">David Swartz</a>, analyst</em></p>\n<h2>Dick’s Sporting Goods <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001PL\">DKS</span> <br/>\nMorningstar Fair Value Estimate: $69.00<br/>\nStock price (as of 1/31/22 close): $115.40<br/>\nPrice/Fair Value: 1.67</h2>\n<p>\"Continuing its amazing momentum, Dick’s Sporting Goods revealed an updated 2021 fourth-quarter and full-year sales and EPS outlook that exceeds our expectations. For the quarter, management now anticipates same-store sales growth, EPS, and adjusted EPS of 3.7%-4.7%, $3.00-$3.09, and $3.45-$3.55, respectively, versus our estimates of 3.0%, $2.37, and $2.75. For the year, it anticipates same-store sales growth, EPS, and adjusted EPS of 25.8%-26.1%, $13.70-$13.79, and $15.50-$15.60 versus our estimates of 25.0%, $13.05, and $14.80. Expected adjusted EPS for 2021’s fourth quarter is only slightly below Dick’s full-year 2019 mark of $3.69.</p>\n<p>\"Dick’s results since mid-2020 have been strong, but we do not think recent profitability can be maintained. For example, the firm is set to report a 2021 operating margin of 16%-17%, but in the long term, we believe operating margins will return to typical mid-single-digit levels. We think Dick’s has benefited from multiple factors in recent quarters--including the surge in demand for activewear during the pandemic, government stimulus programs, and low inventories and discounting throughout the industry--that should fade in 2022. We believe Dick’s has strengths, but we view it as a no-moat retailer without a durable competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>\"We will revisit our financial model and $69 fair value estimate after Dick’s reports full 2021 results in March. As we use a 10-year model, the likely fourth-quarter outperformance by itself has minimal impact on our valuation. Although the stock is inexpensive on trailing earnings, we anticipate Dick’s EPS will decline sharply in 2022 (possibly around 40%) and view it as overvalued. The shares have about doubled over the past year but have dropped about 25% from September’s peak and rose only about 4% on the announcement, likely because investors acknowledge that upcoming comparisons will be extraordinarily tough.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2243/david-swartz\">David Swartz</a>, analyst</em></p>\n<h2>Intuitive Surgical <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00000301\">ISRG</span> <br/>\nMorningstar Fair Value Estimate: $182.00<br/>\nStock price (as of 1/31/22 close): $284.18<br/>\nPrice/Fair Value: 1.56</h2>\n<p>“Having already prereleased its fourth-quarter results, Intuitive’s announcement on Jan. 20 wasn’t particularly surprising. The company’s 2022 procedure growth guidance of 11%-15% is conservative and reflects uncertainty around hospital capacity. We maintain our valuation and wide moat rating on the company.</p>\n<p>\"Over the two-year period--the best way to look at procedures given pauses and restarts in hospital activities, particularly on the elective side--Intuitive delivered 14% average growth in robotic procedures. Overall, demand resilience has been impressive, even as certain high growers, such as hernia surgery, have experienced delays. Notably, outside the United States, we are starting to finally see procedure balance shift away from urology, which has been the primary driver of growth. While we don’t anticipate certain areas of general surgery or gynecology to approach the robotic penetration levels of the U.S., our international thesis rests on Intuitive’s ability to convince practitioners of the platform’s value outside its core urology area.</p>\n<p>\"On the platform placement side, the most noteworthy element is the deceleration of trade-ins in the U.S. We have long stated the upgrade cycle is nearly complete, which will likely pressure system placements, particularly as utilization on the existing platforms still has room to go up. Meanwhile, trade-ins picked up internationally, as this installed base is younger; however, it is also smaller and unlikely to offset a decline in replacements in the U.S. Outside da Vinci, Ion deliveries were strong in the quarter but generally in line with our expectations for this platform.”</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/677/alex-morozov\">Alex Morozov</a>, director</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em style=\"background-color: #efefef; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;\"><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/premium?referid=A4568\" style=\"color: #333333; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;\">Start your free 14-day trial of Morningstar Premium</a>.

With inflation surging in late 2021, investors had to recalibrate their expectations for the Fed. Rates are now expected to rise <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076122\">higher and faster this year.</span> </p>\n<p>With stocks <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073952\">starting off the year</span> at relatively lofty valuations, the market was vulnerable to the kinds of declines seen over the course of the month. That was especially true of many technology and consumer cyclical names that had led the market higher in 2021. </p>\n<p>“You can really see the lopsidedness of the selloff,” says Marta Norton, chief investment officer for the Americas at Morningstar Investment Management. “What was selling off the most was the favorites and what was holding up was the less attractive stocks of the last few years. You had an element of levelling out of the market.”</p>\n<p>After a <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073817\">strong 2021</span>, where stocks were bolstered by surging corporate profits and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic recession, the U.S. Market index hit a new high within days of starting the year. However, things quickly turned south.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19190.png\"/></p>\n<p>\nWith that decline came a noticeable spike in volatility and a white-knuckle ride for investors. To some degree measuring the market’s swings by the close of trading each day didn’t do it justice. For example, on Monday, Jan. 24, stocks collapsed by some 4% in the morning only to finish the session little changed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19193.png\"/></p>\n<p>\nTwo of the biggest trends in January were the rolling over of technology and consumer cyclical stocks, and the collapse of growth names in general.</p>\n<p>Within the Morningstar Style Box, the performance gap among stocks was stark and driven by where they landed on the value vs. growth style spectrum. That contrasted with <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1072648\">2021 performance</span>  where the market value of a stock played had a greater link to performance than whether it was undervalued or a fast-grower.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19195.png\"/><br/>\nFor growth stocks, January’s steep declines reversed a substantial portion of 2021’s gains.</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19189.png\"/></p>\n<p>\nBut over longer time frames, growth and blend stocks still generally hold a substantial advantage over value. That's in part due to value's woes in 2020 when growth outperformed value by record margins. Large- and mid-cap growth stocks in particular remain far ahead compared to value stocks and smaller companies.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19194.png\"/></p>\n<p>The other big trend in January was the collapse of technology and consumer cyclical stocks. These sectors had been major drivers of the market’s 2021 rally and many of these stocks were trading at lofty valuations. <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1075806\">The tech sector's declines</span> have come as investors adjusted to an outlook of higher interest rates and moderating economic growth for this year. </p>\n<p>Among the big-name technology and consumer stocks that have taken a hit in January are NVIDIA <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003RE\">NVDA</span>, which lost 17% in January after a 125% rally in 2021, Microsoft, off 7.5% last month after a 52.2% gain in 2021, and Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>, down 11.4% so far in 2022 after a 49.8% gain last year.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19192.png\"/></p>\n<p>Energy stocks rallied strongly in 2021 and started strong in 2022 on the back of rising oil prices.</p>\n<p>ConocoPhillips <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000001GE\">COP</span>, for example, gained 22.8% in January following an 85.4% rally in 2021. Continental Resources <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00008TJ3\">CLR</span>, meanwhile, is up 16% in 2022 following a 177.4% return last year.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19191.png\"/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Correction:</strong> An earlier version of this story included incorrect data on the U.S. market index, value and growth index performance and sector performance.

Lordstown struggled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/business/lordstown-motors-cash-earnings.html\" target=\"_blank\">to start production due to being low on cash</a>. </p>\n<p>\"For a long time Tesla got to enjoy being the only firm making a good BEV [battery electric vehicle], but that is not true anymore, and it will make life for startups like Rivian (which Ford owns over 12% of) difficult, in my view,\" says Dave Whiston, Morningstar's equity strategist for U.S. autos. \"For over a decade there's been a lot of easy money out there for the likes of a Tesla or new entrants, but with fears of interest rates rising that easy money will not be as easy and could even dry up completely in a recession. Tesla has enough cash at this point to survive but other new entrants may not.\"</p>\n<p>In stark contrast to new EV companies, traditional automakers are on the rise. Ford has climbed 81% in the past 12 months, and has said that it will produce an electric version of the F-150 that will compete against the Cybertruck. While Tesla faces delays, Ford plans a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/ford-nearly-doube-production-electric-f-150-lightning-pickup-truck-rcna10891\" target=\"_blank\">production surge to quickly move in the EV pickup truck market</a>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19104.png\"/></p>\n<p>Toyota <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000005H4\">TM</span>, Volkswagen <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000P7JA\">VWAPY</span>, and General Motors <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000RQZL\">GM</span> are all planning to expand into the EV market. Shares of both Toyota and Volkswagen rose over 30% in the past 12 months, outperforming Tesla. </p>\n<p>\"A few years ago there seemed to be a lot of market concern about the tens of billions of dollars needed for a legacy automaker to transition to EV, but a year ago after GM CEO Mary Barra's CES keynote, the sentiment seemed to shift to be the more that you are spending the better,\" says Whiston. \"Shortly after that keynote GM announced its ambition for its global vehicle lineup to be 100% zero emission by 2035. I think the market finally realized GM has not been joking the past 4 plus years with its various EV announcements.''</p>\n<p>An important change in the landscape are the kinds EVs the traditional automakers are producing.</p>\n<p>“There are Cadillac offerings starting in a few months with the Lyriq crossover, and they are offering BEV pickup trucks now and in the near future with the GMC Hummer, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Ford's F-150 Lightning,\" Whiston says. \"Also, Ford put its iconic Mustang name on a EV over a year ago with the Mach-E. These are the most important and profitable vehicles both firms sell, especially the full size pickups.\"</p>\n<p>Among the traditional automakers, only General Motors and Volkswagen are undervalued at current prices. General Motors has 4-star <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"735356\">Morningstar Rating</span>, while Volkswagen is rated 5 stars. Toyota and Ford are both viewed as fairly valued, rated at 3 stars.</p></xhtml>",

Since the beginning of the pandemic, large-cap stocks have significantly outperformed small-cap and mid-cap stocks, only increasing what has been a decade-long dominance. Indeed, the Morningstar US Large Cap Index has outperformed the broader Morningstar US Market Index in seven out of 10 years. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19083.png\"/></p>\n<p><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1076125\">In our prior article</span>, we highlighted the growth in both number and dollar value of the largest of the large-cap stocks, or mega-cap stocks, which we define as stocks with market capitalizations in excess of $200 billion. It should come as no surprise to investors that after such a long run of outperformance, many mega-cap stocks have run up to levels that we do not think are supported by the companies' long-term underlying fundamentals.</p>\n<p>Here are 12 overvalued mega-cap stocks that we think investors should avoid: </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/19085.png\"/></p>\n<p>Here's an in-depth look at our valuation analysis for three of the names from the list. <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/premium?referid=A4568\">Premium Members</a> can research the ratings and valuations for the remaining companies on each stock's individual analyst report.</p>\n<h2>Pfizer <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000004C0\">PFE</span> </h2>\n<p>\"After a deep dive on several of Pfizer's pipeline drugs combined with continued strong data for COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, we have increased our projections for several key drugs, leading to a fair value estimate increase to $48 from $45.50. We expect Paxlovid sales to peak in the near term at close to $20 billion in annual sales for 2022 followed by a steady decline--but still an annual tail of close to $2 billion.</p>\n<p>\"For the core business of Pfizer, we expect close to 6% annual sales growth between 2020 and 2025 as new drugs offset generic competition. We expect Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine sales will create very strong growth in 2021 and 2022 but likely weigh on growth by 2023 as competitive vaccines erode pricing and demand for Pfizer's vaccine slows as the pandemic fades. On the bottom line, we project a slightly healthier annual growth rate during the next five years as cost-cutting plans and share buybacks take shape. We don't model unannounced acquisitions, but acquisitions hold the potential to accelerate the company's growth rate. Over the long term, we believe the more diversified lineup of drugs should reduce the volatility of earnings. We anticipate restructuring efforts will help alleviate some margin pressure, as some high-margin products lose exclusivity. We estimate Pfizer's cost of equity at 7.5% and weighted average cost of capital at 7.0%, in line with the peer group.\"</p>\n<p>--<em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/757/damien-conover\">Damien Conover</a>, sector strategist</em></p>\n<h2>UnitedHealth Group <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000005NU\">UNH</span> </h2>\n<p>\"Under one roof, UnitedHealth combines a top-tier health insurer (UnitedHealthcare), pharmacy benefit manager (OptumRx), provider (OptumHealth), and health analytics franchise (OptumInsight). The company's integrated strategy has resulted in some of the best returns in the industry in recent years and has been copied at least in part by the late-2018 mergers at CVS Health (added Aetna's insurance assets to its existing retail stores and market-leading PBM) and Cigna (added Express Scripts' PBM assets to its existing insurance operations). Outside of substantial regulator-led reforms, we think these vertically integrated organizations could help bend the healthcare cost curve in the United States, and UnitedHealth should be one of the key leaders of that charge going forward.</p>\n<p>\"UnitedHealth has demonstrated an uncanny ability to remain at the leading edge of changes affecting the industry. For example, its 2015 acquisition of Catamaran greatly increased its PBM scale and helped create a more holistic view of a patient's care. That combination of services has created attractive synergies for clients, such as employers or government programs, that are seeking to lower overall healthcare costs rather than just pharmacy or medical benefits. Adding service providers to the mix aligns incentives even further, especially since the firm's outpatient care assets offer significantly lower costs than hospital-based services. The firm's analytical tools help organizations pull various healthcare information related to its other operations together to provide an even fuller picture of a patient's health and care options.</p>\n<p>\"By providing those diverse yet connected services, UnitedHealth aims to grow in nearly any regulatory environment. Specifically, it is shooting for 13% to 16% earnings growth in the long run including strong operational growth and capital allocation activities, such as acquisitions and repurchases. While some regulatory scenarios could eventually cut into that mission, we suspect the value that UnitedHealth provides to the U.S. healthcare system will help it remain relevant in the long run.\"</p>\n<p>--<em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/628/julie-utterback\">Julie Utterback, senior equity analyst</a></em></p>\n<h2>The Home Depot <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002OY\">HD</span> </h2>\n<p>\"Given the maturity of the domestic home improvement industry, we expect demand to largely depend on changes in the real estate market, driven by prices, interest rates, turnover, and lending standards once COVID-19 subsides. We project 6% average sales growth over the next five years, supported by 5% average same-store sales increases and helped by offerings like buy online/pickup in store and better merchandising, which drives market share gains. Longer term, we forecast gross margins to expand modestly over the next decade (by 30 basis points from 2020 levels, to 34.3%) while the selling, general, and administrative expense ratio leverages by 140 basis points (to 17.1%) and the firm continues to capitalize on its scale and supply chain improvement initiatives. This leads to a terminal operating margin of 15.7%, higher than the 14.6% peak achieved in 2018.</p>\n<p>\"Home Depot's operating margins and returns on invested capital could improve as the firm focuses on the efficiency of the supply chain and the opportunity to better penetrate the pro business with market delivery centers that leverage its delivery capabilities. Additionally, we think Home Depot still has other opportunities to expand the business. It can capitalize on product lines with weak market share leaders, as it has previously done, for example, in appliances (as Sears faltered). Also, having deeper product lines to cross-sell (with brands like Company Store offering exposure to textiles and HD Supply reaching the maintenance, repair, and operations consumer) could add incremental revenue potential. The service business backed by a major national brand, as well as the commercial business coming from Interline and HD Supply, could build brand loyalty and keep consumers returning to a trusted source, something that could be hard to duplicate for a new entrant.\"</p>\n<p>--<em><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/1652/jaime-katz\">Jaime Katz, senior equity analyst</a></em></p></xhtml>",

Our near-term outlook is largely unchanged, as we continue to forecast Tesla will deliver over 1.5 million vehicles in 2022. However, we have reduced our medium-term growth assumptions. We see the affordable sedan and SUV vehicle platform being delayed as management prioritizes the completion of other new vehicles first. Our long-term outlook for Tesla--which assumes the company reduces its cost of goods sold through cheaper batteries and manufacturing efficiencies--is unchanged. Separately, we have incorporated our updated U.S. corporate tax rate assumption, which offset the valuation impact of the delay in the launch of the affordable vehicle platform.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued, trading in 2-star territory. We think the market continues to price in a scenario where Tesla becomes a top-three automaker in global vehicles sold by 2030. As such, although the stock is down roughly 25% from its 52-week high, we still think the current valuation is expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to management saying it would delay the affordable vehicle platform, our other key takeaway from Tesla's results was that the company is likely to face near-term cost increases exceeding recent price increases, which confirmed our prior thinking. We see higher costs coming from higher raw materials and the startup of two new manufacturing plants, one in Austin, Texas, and the other in Berlin. While we forecast Tesla will see gross margins compress in 2022, we think this will be temporary and expect gross margin expansion to resume in 2023. Over the long term, we forecast automotive gross margins will expand from over 29% in 2021 to nearly 39% by 2031. The expansion will be driven by lower manufacturing and the growth of high-margin autonomous driving software.</p>\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><span>\n            <em>Morningstar Premium Members gain exclusive access to our full analyst reports, including fair value estimates, bull and bear breakdowns, and risk analyses.

After all, Vail had a plan to decisively reduce emissions to net zero by 2030 and is using renewable electricity widely. Yet this year, Vail has been plagued by a new sustainability challenge, in the form of widespread staffing problems, raising the ire of skiers and snowboarders. It’s something Baron intends to speak to Vail executives about.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has been tough on ski operators, not least on Vail, which operates popular resorts like Breckenridge, Vail Mountain, Park City, and Whistler-BlackComb, some of the 37 properties that make it the world’s largest ski resort operator. Late in calendar 2021, Vail’s revenues from lift tickets, ski school, and dining revenues were struggling. And staffing challenges mean that parts of popular resorts remain closed. At a visit to Park City early this year, analyst Tyler Batory, who covers Vail stock for Janney, said it “felt crowded on the mountain. It all ties back to labor.”</p>\n<p>“We believe that the significant acceleration of COVID-19 cases associated with the omicron variant has negatively impacted our results along with the broader travel sector as we expect certain guests reconsidered travel plans and were impacted by related flight cancellations,\" Vail CEO Kirsten Lynch said in a statement. As a result, from its Nov. 5 high, Vail stock is down 22% to a recent $290, compared with a 4.8% decline for the Morningstar U.S. Large-Mid Index over the same period. Morningstar equity research doesn’t actively cover Vail shares.</p>\n<p>Sustainability issues go beyond protecting the environment. With millions of people leaving their jobs in what’s being called the “Great Resignation,” add employee retention to a <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1068349\">company’s most important sustainability concerns</span>. Human capital management looks at employees as a form of capital, providing economic value to the company. Organizations that invest in employees, the theory goes, can in turn grow that capital over the long haul. That makes employee retention one of the environmental, social, and governance factors that dominate the discussion of sustainability. “I’m absolutely looking closely at it,” says Batory. “It’s a potential issue to think about it long term.”</p>\n<p>A look at Vail underscores why. Vail’s wages are middling, analysts say, even though it recently instituted a $15 minimum wage at popular resorts and added benefits for sick employees. Jeff Stantial, an analyst at Stifel, notes that many of Vail’s peers “are already at $17 or $18 an hour.” Add to that challenge is the fact living costs are high in resort towns. Consider this comment from Glassdoor, the website where current and former employees anonymously review companies: “Really low pay considering how expensive food is in Vail” is a common complaint.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Vail recently averted a <a href=\"https://www.parkrecord.com/news/business/pcmr-ski-patrol-union-ratifies-deal-with-vail-resorts-ending-possibility-of-a-strike/\">strike by the Park Mountain ski patrol</a>, which provides lift evacuations and avalanche control, by agreeing to an hourly wage of $19, which the ski patrol union said gives workers “wage parity with Colorado resorts.” Vail had originally offered $15.</p>\n<p>And even though the resort operator recently added a $2 per hour bonus to be paid out to workers at the end of the season, “I expect there is still pressure for Vail to raise wages durably,” Stantial says.</p>\n<p>The personnel challenges have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. At Stevens Pass resort in Washington, long lines owing to a lack of lift operators have been normal even as big sections of the mountain remain closed. Vail replaced its general manager with a new one this year. Meanwhile, skiiers and snowboarders signed a petition asking Vail to <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/closed-terrain-staff-shortages-plague-stevens-pass-at-start-of-washingtons-2021-22-ski-season/\">open the mountain</a>.</p>\n<p>Vail generally has a good reputation on sustainability issues. For example, it has a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, and it uses renewable electricity for 85% of its needs at 34 North American resorts. It also donates widely to local organizations that support food and housing assistance and other programs. “Vail Resorts achieved industry-leading sustainability progress, expanded access to the outdoors for those who may not have otherwise had the opportunity, and supported our employees through unexpected challenges and continued education,” CEO Lynch recently said.</p>\n<p>Baron doesn’t regard himself as the kind of investor who meddles with management. He’s quick to point out that he has been a long-term Vail shareholder. “I’ve argued to them for a long time that they should be paying more,” he says. “I have some other ideas to push them to tie people in more” to the company over the long term, “and get them to earn more and have their interests aligned” with those of the company and shareholders. For example, Baron notes that in the past Vail has given employees shares.</p>\n<p>Baron believes Vail will fix its personnel woes: “I’m sure Vail will make progress.” In fact, he can see a path to Vail growing cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) “in the double digits each year, to $1.5 billion in the next five to 10 years. For the current year ending July, Vail expects EBITDA of between $785 million and $835 million, versus $540 million in fiscal 2021 and $499 million the previous year. In fiscal 2019, before the pandemic, it posted EBITDA of $702 million. That, Baron says optimistically, could lead to a doubling of the shares.</p>\n<h2>Sustainable Indexes Leaped Higher in 2021</h2>\n<p>Companies that scored the strongest on ESG metrics saw some of the highest returns in 2021 with help from stocks such as Nvidia <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003RE\">NVDA</span>, Microsoft <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003MH\">MSFT</span>, and Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>.</p>\n<p>The Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index--representing the 50 U.S. companies with the best ESG scores as measured by Sustainalytics (a division of Morningstar)--returned 33.3% for the year, beating the broader U.S. market by more than 8%.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just companies ranked the very highest in ESG scoring that outperformed. Morningstar’s broadest basket of sustainable companies, measured by the 373-stock Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Index, returned 29.1% in 2021, 3 percentage points better than the overall U.S. stock market.</p>\n<p>That ESG strategies outperformed in 2021 is notable given the best-performing stocks across the market last year by far were oil and gas focused energy companies--names that don’t make it past ESG screens. Instead, the companies that are the very strongest from an ESG perspective tend to be large- or mega-cap, high-growth, technology companies. In 2021, these areas of the market did especially well--well enough to power past the gains in energy stocks.</p>\n<p>“This year, companies with better ESG risk assessments outperformed their peers with the weakest ESG assessments,” says Sara Mahaffy, ESG strategist at RBC Capital Markets.</p>\n<p>The outperformance of sustainability strategies was widespread in 2021, based on Morningstar’s data. Within the Morningstar Sustainability Index family (indexes designed to target stocks with low ESG risk ratings), 14 of 21 indexes outperformed over the past year, compared with 18 of 21 outperformers in 2020. Nine out of 10 of the Morningstar Low Carbon Risk indexes beat their benchmarks in 2021.</p>\n<p>And in the fourth quarter, the Morningstar Sustainability Dividend Yield Focus Index, a collection of companies with both healthy income streams and strong ESG scores, posted the highest return, modestly outperforming the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index.</p>\n<p>With the numbers posted in 2021, sustainable investing strategies continue their run of beating conventional market benchmarks over longer periods. Six out of the 10 U.S. sustainability indexes beat their benchmarks over the trailing three-year performance period, as did seven over the five-year period.</p>\n<p>As Jon Hale, head of sustainability research for the Americas at Morningstar, wrote, “Last year's performance adds to the evidence that investments that use [ESG] ratings and metrics to select securities and structure portfolios <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074881\">can deliver competitive returns</span>. </p>\n<p>So why did they outperform? Individual stock weights were a big part of the story.</p>\n<p>\"When ESG funds exclude less-sustainable companies, they tend to pile up positions in mega-caps that earn better ESG metrics,” meaning that they have a disproportionately higher representation than the conventional index, says Lan Anh Tran, associate manager research analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar. “Companies like Microsoft and Tesla that pass ESG screens end up carrying nearly 2 times their broader market weight. That has implications on performance.” For example, Microsoft, which gained 52% last year, has a 3 times greater weight in the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index than in the broader market.</p>\n<p>These individual stock weights help offset some market sector headwinds in 2021, most notably the lack of energy stocks, which produced their strongest returns in more than 10 years. Still, the energy sector is just a small part of the overall market, making up less than 3% of the Morningstar U.S. Market Index.</p>\n<p>To be sure, as stocks slid so far this year, sustainable indexes have fallen by more. The wide Morningstar U.S. Sustainability index is down 6.5%, versus 5.5% for the Morningstar U.S. market index as of Jan. 19. That could change if the market comes roaring back.</p></xhtml>",

Nine out of 10 of the Morningstar Low Carbon Risk indexes beat their benchmarks in 2021. </p>\n<p>And in the fourth quarter, the Morningstar Sustainability Dividend Yield Focus Index, a collection of companies with both healthy income streams and strong ESG scores, posted the highest return, modestly outperforming the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index. </p>\n<p>With the numbers posted in 2021, sustainable investing strategies continue their run of beating conventional market benchmarks over longer periods. Six out of the 10 U.S. sustainability indexes beat their benchmarks over the trailing three-year performance period, as did seven over the five-year period. </p>\n<p>As Jon Hale, head of sustainability research for the Americas at Morningstar, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074881\">wrote</span>, “Last year's performance adds to the evidence that investments that use environmental, social, and governance ratings and metrics to select securities and structure portfolios can deliver competitive returns.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18978.png\"/></p>\n<p>Under the hood, a number of factors worked in favor of sustainable strategies in 2021.</p>\n<p>Lan Anh Tran, associate manager research analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, notes that individual stock weights were a big part of the story.</p>\n<p>\"When ESG funds exclude less-sustainable companies, they tend to pile up positions in mega-caps that earn better ESG metrics,” meaning that they have a disproportionately higher representation than the conventional index, says Tran. “Companies like Microsoft and Tesla that pass ESG screens end up carrying nearly 2 times their broader market weight. That has implications on performance.”</p>\n<p>In 2021, those weights worked in favor of ESG strategies. Nvidia, a mega-cap tech company that returned over 125% in 2021, has a 3 times greater weight in the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index than in the broader market. It’s a similar story with Microsoft, which gained 52% last year. The software giant constitutes nearly 10% of both the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders and the standard Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Index, compared with just over 5% of the Morningstar U.S. Market Index.</p>\n<p>Another factor is companies that don’t make it past the stricter screens. All of the stocks in the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index have <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1038415\">Sustainalytics 4- or 5-Globe Ratings</span>, indicating that each company is managing relevant ESG risks more effectively than industry peers.</p>\n<p>Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000W3KZ\">FB</span>  and Amazon.com <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000B7\">AMZN</span>, for example, can be  excluded from ESG portfolios based on assessments of their negative societal impacts or corporate governance risks. Because these stocks are so large, that leaves a gap that tends to get filled by the large-cap ESG heavyweights. “Simple ESG screening strategies are always going to look similar to the broader market,” adds Tran, “but stricter screens can result in stark differences.”</p>\n<p>“These differences in weight are notable,” says Tran, “but they’re also a quirk.” One that can either help or hurt the performance of ESG strategies. “If Microsoft took a hit, then ESG would too.”</p>\n<p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18979.png\"/></p>\n<p>These individual stock weights help offset some market sector headwinds in 2021, most notably the lack of energy stocks.</p>\n<p>ESG screens often avoid the energy sector, an area of the market filled with oil and gas companies. The Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index had virtually no exposure to the energy sector last year, and the less-extreme Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Index cuts out half of the energy weight that the Morningstar U.S. Market Index is exposed to. </p>\n<p>But even as the Morningstar U.S. Energy index gained 55% in 2021 (the strongest return the sector has seen in more than 10 years), sustainability outperformed the overall market. That’s mainly because the energy sector is just a small part of the overall market, making up less than 3% of the Morningstar U.S. Market Index.</p>\n<p>“Yes, energy did well this year” says Tran, “but it makes up a small enough portion of the broader market indexes that it doesn’t make a huge difference for overall performance.”</p>\n<p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18980.png\"/></p>\n<p>The tech and consumer cyclical sectors had a more notable impact on sustainability portfolios. Over the past five years, the Morningstar U.S. Technology Index has grown more than 30% and the Morningstar U.S. Consumer Cyclical Index is up 24%, ahead of all other U.S. sector indexes--and both the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders and Morningstar U.S. Sustainability indexes carry extra concentrations in those two areas.</p>\n<p>In 2021, those differences in composition contributed to sustainability stocks’ group outperformance. Though none of the other top contributors saw gains as large as Nvidia's, both Accenture <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000004C\">ACN</span>  and Home Depot <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000002OY\">HD</span>  rose nearly 60% for the year, with Microsoft close behind at a 52% return.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18981.png\"/></p>\n<p>Among U.S. indexes, the Morningstar Sustainability Dividend Yield Focus Index performed the best in the fourth quarter, recovering from weakness earlier in the year. The index is a group of companies with both healthy dividends and strong management of ESG risk. Gains in the index were led by healthcare company and maker of the first available coronavirus vaccine Pfizer <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000004C0\">PFE</span>  (up 39% for the quarter) and semiconductor producer Broadcom <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000KU35\">AVGO</span>  (up 38%). The index gained 12.7% in the last three months of 2021, followed closely by the Morningstar U.S. Sustainability Leaders Index, which gained 12.5% during the same period. Despite the strong year for sustainability portfolios, 2021 was muted for ESG compared with 2020. Globally and across all markets, 61% of Morningstar’s ESG-screened indexes beat their broad market equivalents in 2021, down slightly from 72% in 2020.

We found those funds tended to struggle in the years that followed their 100%-plus year. Now that a year has gone by, we thought we'd check back in on the 18 funds that gained 100% or more in 2020 to see how they did in 2021.</p>\n<h2>What We Found</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>The 18 funds that gained 100% or more in 2020 lost 2.6% on average in 2021 and were down another 12% for the year to date through Jan. 13, 2022.</li>\n    <li>Twelve of the 18 funds lost money last year, the deepest loss being around 24%.</li>\n    <li>The average fund saw a 26% peak-to-trough drawdown in 2021; every fund suffered a drawdown of at least 15%.</li>\n    <li>All but four of the funds finished in their Morningstar Category's bottom decile last year; the average fund lagged its category benchmark index by around 20%. </li>\n    <li>The two best-performing funds, Baron Partners <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA02W9R\">BPTRX</span>  and Baron Focused Growth <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06UOI\">BFGFX</span>, rode huge Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>  stakes to big gains in 2021.</li>\n    <li>Despite the weakness in 2021, these funds still boast strong long-term results.</li>\n    <li>The outlook for these funds' holdings is mixed; the sell-off has made them less pricey but not invitingly cheap.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A Tough Year</h2>\n<p>Last year was a tough one for the 18 funds that gained 100% or more in 2020. The majority lost money and, in general, the higher they rose in 2020, the harder they fell in 2021, as shown below: </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18931.png\"/></p>\n<p>The average fund lost 2.6% in a topsy-turvy year that showed early promise but then took a turn for the worse in the spring. All told, every fund saw at least a 15% drawdown, the average drawdown being 26%.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit 2: Maximum Drawdown: Jan, 1 2021 Through Dec. 31, 2021</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18935.jpg\"/><br/>\n<em> Source: Morningstar.</em></p>\n<p>True, these funds fared better in 2021 than did other funds in the 12 months that followed the calendar year in which they notched a triple-digit gain. Indeed, entering 2021, the average fund that gained 100% or more in a calendar year skidded to a 9.9% loss in the 12 months that followed it.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, unlike the other subsequent 12-month periods we examined, 2021 was a year in which relatively few stock funds notched losses amid a continuing bull market. For that reason, it makes sense to also look at these 18 funds' returns relative to the market. After crushing their category benchmark indexes in 2020, these 18 funds significantly lagged in 2021, with the average fund trailing its benchmark by almost 20%.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18932.png\"/></p>\n<h2>Exceptions to the Rule</h2>\n<p>Two funds bucked the trend, however: In 2021, Baron Partners and Baron Focused Growth gained 31.4% and 18.8%, respectively, topping their indexes and most of their category peers.</p>\n<p>What explains their success in an otherwise forgettable 2021 for these 18 funds? Tesla. The Baron funds held huge stakes in the electric vehicle manufacturer throughout 2021. When Tesla soared, as it did through much of 2021, that cemented the funds' strong showing.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18933.png\"/></p>\n<h2>It's Just One Year</h2>\n<p>While 2021 was difficult for most of these 18 funds, nearly all continue to boast good long-term records. To illustrate, here are the funds' average excess returns (vs. their category indexes) over the trailing three- and five-year periods ended Dec. 31, 2021.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18934.png\"/></p>\n<p>All told, 15 of the 18 funds still boasted a 4- or 5-star Morningstar Rating as of Dec. 31, 2021.</p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n<p>These 18 funds have gotten off to a rough start thus far in 2022, with the average fund tumbling to an 12% loss for the year to date through Jan. 13. While that might be discouraging to the funds' shareholders, the silver lining is that the funds' holdings look a bit less expensive than before. To illustrate, the following exhibit tracks the price/cash flow ratio of the 18 funds' underlying holdings in aggregate over the past few years </p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit 6: Time-Lapse of Price/Cash Flow Ratio of 18 Funds' Aggregate Stock Holdings</strong><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18936.jpg\"/><br/>\n<em>Source: Morningstar.</em></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, these funds' holdings are hardly cheap, as shown in the next exhibit, which runs the 18 funds' aggregate holdings through Morningstar's Factor Profile tool:</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit 7: Factor Profile of the 18 Funds' Aggregate Stock Holdings</strong> <br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18937.jpg\"/><br/>\n<em>Source: Morningstar.</em></p>\n<p>To summarize, the 18 funds' holdings are more highly valued than the growth-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, and far exceed the S&amp;P 500's valuation (Style in the exhibit above). When compared with the S&amp;P 500's holdings, the 18 funds own stocks that:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>yield less (Yield),</li>\n    <li>exhibit higher share price momentum (Momentum),</li>\n    <li>are tied to less profitable and more leveraged firms (Quality),</li>\n    <li>have very volatile returns (Volatility),</li>\n    <li>trade heavily (Liquidity), and</li>\n    <li>are tied small or midsize businesses (Size). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These funds have nearly three fourths of their assets stashed away in pricey sectors like technology (35%), consumer cyclical (24%), and communication services (15%), with healthcare soaking up another 14%.</p>\n<p>And even after this pullback, these funds' holdings don't look invitingly cheap to our analysts. In aggregate, the funds' holdings were recently trading at a roughly 7% premium to our analysts' fair value estimates, with the top 10 holdings of this group shown below.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18956.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 742px;\"/></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Most of the 18 funds that gained 100% or more in 2020 fared poorly in 2021. While these funds continue to boast strong long-term records, our research has found that this weakness can persist.</p>\n<p>There's no guarantee that pattern will play out with respect to these 18 funds, and their holdings have gotten less expensive amid the recent pullback. Moreover, for investors who have a suitably long time horizon and the patience to wait out potential adversity, there are several funds on the list that our analysts highly recommend, such as Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00DR7\">MSEQX</span>, which has a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18957.png\" style=\"width: 836px; height: 902px;\"/></p>\n<p>But given the historical pattern we've observed and the mixed fundamental outlook for these funds' holdings, performance will bear watching in the months ahead. We'll report back as developments warrant.</p></xhtml>",

But simple was best in 2021, as the exchange-traded fund portfolios soundly beat their mutual fund counterparts, which tilt heavily toward active funds. </p>\n<p>All six of the baseline portfolios geared toward retirement savers (people in the accumulation phase) notched double-digit gains in 2021, a year in which the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 30%. While high-quality bonds struggled amid news of interest-rate hikes in 2021, four of the six portfolios have fairly light fixed income exposure: just 5% for the Aggressive portfolios and 20% for the Moderate ones. (The Conservative portfolios, which are geared toward risk-intolerant investors and/or those nearing retirement, have substantially more in fixed income, at roughly 50% of total assets.)</p>\n<p>One of the most striking features of the portfolios’ 2021 results was the extent to which the ETF portfolios bested their mutual fund counterparts. Even though Oakmark <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00E9D\">OAKMX</span> and Oakmark International Small Cap <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00D7A\">OAKEX</span> were standout performers for the mutual fund portfolios, the portfolios’ aggregate equity exposure failed to best the plain-vanilla index trackers in the ETF portfolios. The ETF portfolios also got a bit of a boost from their dash of small-value exposure, as small-value stocks came on strong after a string of lackluster gains in the years prior. </p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"860459\">Aggressive Mutual Fund Saver Portfolio</span></h2>\n<p>20% Primecap Odyssey Growth <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA05B59\">POGRX</span> <br/>\n20% Oakmark Fund <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00E9D\">OAKMX</span> <br/>\n15% Vanguard Extended Market Index <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00LB6\">VEXAX</span> <br/>\n33% Vanguard Total International Stock Index <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000JTEF\">VTIAX</span> <br/>\n7% Oakmark International Small Cap <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00D7A\">OAKEX</span> <br/>\n5% Metropolitan West Total Return Bond <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00I2N\">MWTRX</span> <br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 16.53%</p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"860460\">Moderate Mutual Fund Saver Portfolio</span> </h2>\n<p>15% Primecap Odyssey Growth<br/>\n15% Oakmark Fund<br/>\n15% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000QKM9\">VDADX</span> <br/>\n10% Vanguard Extended Market Index<br/>\n21% Vanguard Total International Stock Index<br/>\n5% Oakmark International Small Cap<br/>\n19% Metropolitan West Total Return Bond<br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 15.21%</p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"860461\">Conservative Mutual Fund Saver Portfolio</span></h2>\n<p>10% Primecap Odyssey Growth<br/>\n10% Oakmark Fund<br/>\n10% Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index<br/>\n7% Vanguard Extended Market Index<br/>\n10% Vanguard Total International Stock Index<br/>\n4% Oakmark International Small Cap<br/>\n30% Metropolitan West Total Return Bond<br/>\n7% Fidelity Short-Term Bond <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA00CI8\">FSHBX</span> <br/>\n12% Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000ONBX\">VTAPX</span><br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 10.31%</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Recap:</strong> All of the stock funds in the portfolio delivered strong gains in absolute terms in 2021, though just one of the funds in the portfolios (Oakmark Fund) managed to beat the S&amp;P 500 last year. Meanwhile, Primecap Odyssey Growth and Vanguard Extended Market Index both had years to forget. Primecap Odyssey Growth resides in the large-growth Morningstar Category, but its contrarian growth strategy has kept it notably light on stocks such as Apple <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000000GY\">AAPL</span>, which  have helped some of its peers deliver stellar results over the past three and five years. Vanguard Extended Market Index, meanwhile, skews toward the small- and mid-growth squares of the Morningstar Style Box, which were the worst-performing parts of the style box last year. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index, a holding in the Moderate and Conservative portfolios, also underperformed the S&amp;P and its large-blend peers; its light weighting in technology stocks was a key culprit.</p>\n<p>On the fixed-income side, core bond holding Metropolitan West Total Return Bond posted a lackluster showing amid a tough year for high-quality bonds. It was positioned defensively, de-emphasizing lower-quality bonds, but such bonds outperformed higher-quality credits amid interest-rate jitters in 2021. And the Aggressive and Moderate portfolios lacked exposure to one of the bright spots in the bond space last year: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. (I wouldn’t typically recommend an allocation to TIPS for people who aren’t yet retired or getting close to retirement.)</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio Changes:</strong> None. All of the holdings in the mutual fund portfolios retain Morningstar Medalist ratings at this juncture. However, investors who haven’t rebalanced recently, especially between growth and value, large and small, and U.S. and non-U.S., might consider doing so, as the performance differential has been stark over the past three- and five-year periods. </p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"845143\">Aggressive ETF Saver Portfolio</span></h2>\n<p>50% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA0002P\">VTI</span>  <br/>\n10% Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04ACH\">VBR</span>  <br/>\n30% Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06JJS\">VEA</span>  <br/>\n5% Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA04ADG\">VWO</span>  <br/>\n5% iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000TNI6\">IUSB</span><br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 19.14%</p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"845141\">Moderate ETF Saver Portfolio</span></h2>\n<p>47% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF<br/>\n8% Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF<br/>\n20% Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF<br/>\n5% Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF<br/>\n20% iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF<br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 16.44%</p>\n<h2><span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"845187\">Conservative ETF Saver Portfolio</span> </h2>\n<p>33% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF<br/>\n5% Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF<br/>\n10% Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF<br/>\n4% Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF<br/>\n30% iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF<br/>\n11% Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000ONBY\">VTIP</span> <br/>\n7% Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FOUSA06C1U\">BSV</span>\n<br/>\n<strong>2021 Return:</strong> 11.21%</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Recap:</strong> All three of the ETF portfolios performed better than their mutual fund counterparts, as noted above.

Investors emerged clear winners. Today, an investor can build a portfolio of index funds representing virtually every stock and bond on the planet with a blended expense ratio of 0.06%. That's just $6 for every $10,000 invested. </p>\n<p>As tiny fees become the new standard, it's time to look at other ways that the providers of ETFs and index mutual funds can add value back to shareholders. Now that these funds' fees have been squeezed, these practices may matter more than a 0.01 percentage point difference in expense ratios. This article will explore a few methods already employed in the index fund industry that haven't grabbed as many headlines as funds with no fees. </p>\n<h2>Passive but Not Idle </h2>\n<p>With their wide scope and low turnover, broad market-cap-weighted index funds are often considered the ultimate long-term owners of the securities in their portfolios. But instead of sitting on these securities, many funds put them to work on behalf of their shareholders. Funds will often loan out portfolio securities in exchange for a lending fee, a practice commonly referred to as securities lending. The bulk of the revenue generated from these loans gets passed back to shareholders, adding to funds' returns. But there is risk involved. To protect fund shareholders against potential borrower default, the transaction typically requires collateral from the borrowers, which could be cash or noncash securities. If the collateral is noncash, that is, government securities (U.S. Treasuries or U.S. agency debt) or a letter of credit, the transaction is straightforward: The borrowers pay the fee and the lenders deliver the securities after the collateral is received. On the other hand, if the collateral is cash, lenders often reinvest the collateral and the income generated can offset the lending fee, sometimes entirely. The current market best practice is overcollateralization of at least 102% of the borrowed securities' value for domestic securities and 105% for foreign securities. After the 2008 global financial crisis, when aggressive cash collateral investment resulted in losses for some lenders, the SEC began suggesting conservative investment of cash collateral in highly liquid securities. </p>\n<p>There are also costs involved. Not all the income generated through securities lending is passed back to fund shareholders. A portion of these revenues covers the costs associated with running these programs. The revenue split between fund providers and fund shareholders varies depending on the fund in question. The percentage of gross lending revenue passed on to fund investors can range anywhere from 60% to 100%. Fund companies can use a third-party broker or an affiliated lending agent. There are advantages and drawbacks to both. While a third-party agent might charge a higher fee, having an in-house lending unit can raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest. We examined this in great detail <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"904334\">in our 2018 white paper on securities lending</span>.</p>\n<p>Fund shareholders can find details on funds' securities-lending income in the income statement of their annual reports. For most funds, this number is immaterial. Most of the demand in the securities-lending market centers around smaller stocks, which are particularly popular among short-sellers--the most common borrowers. Small-cap stocks typically take up a small portion of most broad market-cap-weighted funds' assets. But for dedicated mid- and small-cap funds, securities-lending income can be a big deal. Exhibit 1 shows the annual securities-lending income generated by a sample of prominent funds representing different market-cap strata. More comprehensive data on funds' securities-lending activity began being reported to the SEC through Form N-CEN in 2018. This data is available on the SEC website and Morningstar Direct. The figures in Exhibit 1 are calculated using end-of-period net assets and might be different from the N-CEN figures, which use average daily assets.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18820.png\"/></p>\n<p>Small-cap funds consistently reap the greatest gains from securities lending. The poster child for this phenomenon is iShares Russell 2000 ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"FEUSA00017\">IWM</span>, which is the most prolific lender of portfolio holdings among major index funds. IWM often generates approximately 0.20% of additional annual return on a yearly basis--often enough to cover its 0.19% expense ratio. As a result, IWM lagged Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000J3KK\">VTWO</span>  by just 0.02% annually from VTWO's 2010 inception through August 2021, despite the fact that IWM currently charges a fee that is nearly twice VTWO's. (VTWO shaved its fee in 2019, but it had previously been 5 basis points lower than IWM's expense ratio.)</p>\n<h2>Taming Turnover Costs</h2>\n<p>In indexing, precision is paramount. In addition to lending out positions to generate additional income and pull their funds' returns closer to their target, index-fund managers also focus on minimizing the costs of turnover. </p>\n<p>Turnover costs generally take two forms. Some, like commissions and bid-ask spreads, are readily measurable. Others are more elusive. Chief among these immeasurables is market impact cost--the degree to which these funds' turnover pushes the prices of the securities they are buying away from them. For example, how much did S&amp;P 500-tracking index portfolios' purchases of Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span>  shares push the stock's price higher when the firm was added to the index in 2020? To quote the old Tootsie Pops commercial, \"The world may never know.\" </p>\n<p>Index fund managers have to make price-insensitive trades to mimic their benchmarks; they don't have the same luxury as active managers who can trade what, when, and how much they want to. In the constant trade-off between tracking performance and transaction costs, the scale has often tilted toward the former. But that's begun to change. </p>\n<p>As index funds have grown and the technology their managers employ has improved, many index providers and fund sponsors have tried to tame turnover costs. The tactics they've employed often manifest themselves in the methodologies of the indexes that underpin these funds. In general, the approaches taken by these benchmarks are designed to either slow turnover or to spread it out. Exhibit 2 provides a snapshot of common techniques designed to meet each objective.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"grid-width\" src=\"https://im.morningstar.com/content/CMSImages/18821.png\"/></p>\n<h2>Slowing Turnover </h2>\n<p>The first line of defense against transaction costs is to reduce the frequency and volume of turnover. Fewer changes to the index lineup means less trading for fund managers and lower transaction costs. </p>\n<p>Some index providers intentionally reduce the frequency of index reconstitution as a means of curbing turnover. The S&amp;P 500, for instance, has no fixed review schedule and reconstitutes on an as-needed basis at the index committee's discretion. While this approach is not transparent, it can lower turnover compared with a recurring review schedule. Many broad-market indexes reconstitute annually and opt to include IPOs at their quarterly or semiannual rebalances. </p>\n<p>Buffer rules that allow current constituents to temporarily stray from indexes' eligibility criteria have slowly become the new norm for rules-based indexes. Securities that flip-flop around these thresholds are given leeway to reduce unnecessary turnover. Most major broad-market indexes have adopted some form of buffer. The ones that don't do so stand out, perhaps most notably the Russell 2000 Index. The lack of a buffer at the widely followed index's lower threshold has resulted in meaningful transaction costs over the benchmark's long history.</p>\n<p>However, these buffering approaches tend to work better for broad, market-cap-weighted indexes than those that base security selection and weighting on more-targeted and timely data, like those targeting momentum. Reducing turnover often means drifting from a factor exposure or theme.</p>\n<h2>Spreading Turnover</h2>\n<p>Many indexes have also introduced means of spreading turnover across a longer period and/or splitting it up across multiple, partial rebalances. This can help to reduce the market impact of turnover and may reduce the influence of <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3673910\" target=\"_blank\">rebalance timing luck</a> on some indexes' performance. For example, Research Affiliates' RAFI index series--save for the FTSE RAFI indexes--rebalances in four tranches. The portfolio is split into four identical tranches, and each tranche takes its turn rebalancing at its designated quarterly rebalance. CRSP indexes move positions through a \"packeting\" approach. This approach can both slow and spread rebalancing. The methodology entails moving just 50% of a position that may be straddling size or style borders between its benchmarks at any given reconstitution.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, many indexes are also spreading rebalances over several days instead of doing it all in one go on a single date. CRSP indexes--which underpin many of Vanguard's U.S. equity ETFs--were first movers on this front. They switched from a one-day rebalance to a five-day rebalance in 2017. The S&amp;P Dividend Growers index series, the new indexes for the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation funds, rebalances over three days. In November 2020, iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"F00000PF2S\">MTUM</span>  switched to a new variant of its original benchmark. Its new bogy rebalances over three days instead of one. As the funds that track them get bigger, these indexes are being tweaked to tread more lightly in an effort to minimize their market impact.</p>\n<h2>All the Small Things</h2>\n<p>As index-tracking funds' fees have shriveled and their assets have swelled, small things like securities lending and turnover costs have become a bigger deal. These two topics only scratch the surface of the myriad improvements in implementation that the managers of index funds look to make to their processes on a day-to-day basis to eke out every last basis point of performance on behalf of fund shareholders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"CMS__FinePrint\">Disclosure: Morningstar, Inc. licenses indexes to financial institutions as the tracking indexes for investable products, such as exchange-traded funds, sponsored by the financial institution.

Valuations appear stretched. Economic growth is slowing. Inflation is higher than it's been in decades. And the Federal Reserve is tapering its asset purchase program and plans to raise interest rates. </p>\n<p>What can investors expect from the economy and stock market this year?</p>\n<p>\"Despite a slowdown in GDP growth in the third quarter of 2021, along with rising concerns around inflation and the new omicron coronavirus variant, we think the U.S. economic recovery is far from finished,\" notes senior analyst <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2047/preston-caldwell\">Preston Caldwell</a>. Our equity research team's <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073955\">gross domestic product forecast for 2022</span>  is 3.9%. Moreover, the team doesn't view inflation as a threat to the recovery; it projects inflation will fall to 3.0% this year and average 2.2% over 2022-25.</p>\n<h2>What About Stocks?</h2>\n<p>\"Although the market is broadly overvalued, we see upside opportunity for investors in the value category and small-cap stocks, both of which should benefit from continued economic prosperity,\" says  Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/1514/david-sekera\">Dave Sekera</a>. He also notes that if inflation persists, wide-moat stocks are a good place to be, because these companies usually have better pricing power and therefore a better chance of maintaining their profit margins. And be sure to read Dave's <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073952\">outlook for 2022</span>  to find out what market sector offers the most upside potential today based on our valuation metrics.</p>\n<p>(Those Smart Investor readers interested in-depth recaps of the year in the markets, funds, and stocks can check out our comprehensive special report, \"<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1071493\">Morningstar's Take on 2021.\"</span>)</p>\n<h2>33 Undervalued Stocks for 2022</h2>\n<p>At the start of each year, I pull together an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/collections/172/our-picks\">Our Picks</a> article that focuses on the three top ideas from our analysts across 11 different sectors. This year's installment, \"<span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073704\">33 Undervalued Stocks for 2022</span>,\" includes some names familiar to regular readers of the column, because these stocks have popped up in recent Our Picks articles--names like Hanesbrands <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P00006B3Q\">HBI</span>, Polaris <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000004EA\">PII</span>, Merck <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003KE\">MRK</span>, and Salesforce.com <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000004T1\">CRM</span>, for instance. Other stocks on the list, however, we've talked less about, like Macerich <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P000003EN\">MAC</span>  and Lithium Americas <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000JU6Z\">LAC</span>.</p>\n<p>What floors me is that, although our analysts think the market is about 5% overvalued heading into the new year, several stocks on this week's picks list are trading at half of what our analysts think they're worth, representing tremendous upside potential in what many consider an otherwise frothy market. Perhaps it's time to back up the truck--or dip a toe in, depending on your investing temperament.</p>\n<p>Also, I want to plug the outlook pieces that our sector directors and strategists write each quarter. They're insightful reads. Find out <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074063\">whether the worst is yet to come for utilities</span>, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074062\">why the healthcare sector has lagged the broader market</span>, and <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1074048\">whether we think the recent carnage in communication services stocks will persist</span>, <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1071493\">among other sector insights</span>.</p>\n<h2>Stock of the Week: Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Security\" title=\"0P0000OQN8\">TSLA</span> </h2>\n<p>Early this week, Tesla <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073796\">reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year vehicle delivery numbers</span>, boosting its total number of vehicles delivered by 87% versus 2020. After adjusting for these better-than-expected numbers and an increased 2022 forecast, analyst <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2043/seth-goldstein\">Seth Goldstein</a> reported that Morningstar raised its fair value estimate on Tesla to $700 from $680. That means shares are only 64% overvalued as of this writing, according to our metrics. Seth, of course, agrees with just about everyone else that Tesla is a disruptor, but it's <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1073357\">a terribly overpriced disruptor</span>  today.</p>\n<h2>Your 2022 Financial Calendars</h2>\n<p>Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/authors/30/christine-benz\">Christine Benz</a> kicks off each new year with practical content focused on helping investors accomplish key financial jobs. <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1072684\">Your 2022 Financial To-Do List</span>  is Christine's month-by-month calendar that breaks down some daunting yet important money tasks; she makes them more manageable to check off your to-do list. Christine and I also talk about each month's tasks in videos that publish near the start of each month; you can watch our conversation about <span class=\"CMS__Document\" title=\"1072533\">January's financial to-dos</span>. </p>\n<p>Happy New Year to all Smart Investor readers!

In less than a decade, the company went from a startup to a globally recognized luxury automaker with its Model S and Model X vehicles. In addition to luxury autos, the company competes in the midsize car and crossover SUV market with its platform that is used for Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Tesla also plans to sell multiple new vehicles over the next several years. These include a platform that will be used to make an affordable sedan and SUV, a light truck, a semi truck, and a sports car.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s strategy is to maintain its market leader status as EVs grow from a niche auto market to reaching mass consumer adoption. To do so, the company is undergoing a massive capacity expansion to increase the number of vehicles it can produce. Tesla also invests around 5% of its sales in research and development, focusing on improving its market-leading technology and reducing its manufacturing costs. For EVs to see mass adoption, they need to reach cost and function parity with internal combustion engines. To reduce costs, Tesla focuses on automation and efficiency in its manufacturing process, such as reducing the total number of parts that need to be assembled in a vehicle. The company will also move upstream into battery production, with a goal to reduce costs by over 50%.</p>\n<p>To reach functional parity, EV will need to have adequate range, reduced charging times, and availability of charging infrastructure. Tesla’s extended-range EVs are already at range parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, and this should improve further with plans for its batteries to increase energy density. Tesla continues to expand its supercharging network, which consists of fast chargers built along highways and in cities throughout the United States, European Union, and China. The company is attempting to take a larger share of its customers’ auto-related spending, which includes selling insurance and offering paid services such as autonomous driving functions.</p>\n<p>Tesla also sells solar panels and batteries used for energy storage to consumers and utilities. As the solar generation and battery storage market expands, Tesla is well positioned to grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1073796/tesla-reports-strong-quarter-we-raise-fve-to-700\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla Reports Strong Quarter; We Raise FVE to $700</a></p>\n<h2>Key Proprietary Morningstar Metrics </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/735361/the-morningstar-fair-value-estimate\" target=\"_blank\">Fair Value Estimate</a>: $700<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/735356/the-morningstar-rating-for-stocks\" target=\"_blank\">Star Rating</a>: 2 Stars<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/735365/the-morningstar-economic-moat-rating\" target=\"_blank\">Economic Moat Rating</a>: Narrow<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/735365/the-morningstar-economic-moat-rating\" target=\"_blank\">Moat Trend Rating</a>: Stable</p>\n<p><em>To read the full analyst report for Tesla and 1,500 other stocks, start your <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/sign-up/premium?referid=A4490\" target=\"_blank\">free 14-day trial</a> of Morningstar Premium.

                    "note":"<xhtml><p>Having updated our model to incorporate Tesla's detailed fourth-quarter and full-year results, we are maintaining our $700 fair value estimate and narrow moat rating. Our near-term outlook is largely unchanged, as we continue to forecast Tesla will deliver over 1.5 million vehicles in 2022. However, we have reduced our medium-term growth assumptions. We see the affordable sedan and SUV vehicle platform being delayed as management prioritizes the completion of other new vehicles first. Our long-term outlook for Tesla--which assumes the company reduces its cost of goods sold through cheaper batteries and manufacturing efficiencies--is unchanged. Separately, we have incorporated our updated U.S. corporate tax rate assumption, which offset the valuation impact of the delay in the launch of the affordable vehicle platform.</p><p>At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued, trading in 2-star territory. We think the market continues to price in a scenario where Tesla becomes a top-three automaker in global vehicles sold by 2030. As such, although the stock is down roughly 25% from its 52-week high, we still think the current valuation is expensive.</p><p>In addition to management saying it would delay the affordable vehicle platform, our other key takeaway from Tesla's results was that the company is likely to face near-term cost increases exceeding recent price increases, which confirmed our prior thinking. We see higher costs coming from higher raw materials and the startup of two new manufacturing plants, one in Austin, Texas, and the other in Berlin. While we forecast Tesla will see gross margins compress in 2022, we think this will be temporary and expect gross margin expansion to resume in 2023. Over the long term, we forecast automotive gross margins will expand from over 29% in 2021 to nearly 39% by 2031. The expansion will be driven by lower manufacturing and the growth of high-margin autonomous driving software.</p></xhtml>",
