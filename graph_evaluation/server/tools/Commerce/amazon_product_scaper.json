This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY.  It doesn’t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds, and that’s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too, it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly, loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don’t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops, but if you’re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you’re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics, you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it, i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet, and it doesn’t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up, but i don’t plan on using it portably so I can’t speak to that. This was worth every penny, and I’m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price. I don’t see how it gets any better than this for little ol’ me",

This ended up making the laptop much cheaper then buying one with that much ram and size of SSD in it on its own.The way the heat is distributed on this laptop (near the back by the screen) keeps my wrists from burning up like I have had with prior laptops.This thing has been able to run every game I play with at least 60fps on ultra settings.New world ultra settings - around 60-80fpsFF14 ultra settings - around 100 fps tbd the areaCall of duty medium settings - around 120 (did this on purpose to take advantage of the higher refresh rate)Smite Ultra settings - 80+ fpsThis laptop is hands down the best bang for your buck.  If you are really looking for a higher end laptop then your going to be spending between the $1500-2000 mark.  If you are trying to keep it under $1000 this was the best performance I was able to find for the price.",

After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptop.Decided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra $100 after the price went up. Customer service was not accommodating in the least.  The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time. Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again.",

                        "review":"Good laptop, this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it’s @2933 and you should be okay. I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it’s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it’s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well. I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn’t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4. I can’t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700$ range that only runs on integrated graphics it’s just not worth the money.",

After a panicky hour of trying to figure out what's wrong with my brand new very expensive laptop, and realizing how many one star reviews were here for this exact issue, I cannot stress this enough, SHOVE THE CHARGER IN. It is VERY SNUG and you really REALLY have to push it hard. There is a very significant click of the charger going in, and as soon as it did everything was fine. Haven't used it yet, but wanted to update, as I now understand what all the one star reviews about this laptop being DOA are really about. Happy gaming!",

                        "review":"Like a moth to a flame I was mesmerized by the value and great review ratings and I ignored the fact that there are at least SIX REVIEWS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS saying their machine (like mine) wouldn’t even turn on!! Most stores would recognize this as a problem but Amazon shamefully just keeps selling this junk.  This was in my house 3 hours before I got my money back along with arrangements for them to pick up the craptop at my door to return it.  I will find another (non Acer) laptop, and I will buy it from somewhere other than Amazon.  There has to be a price to pay for knowingly selling defective products.EDIT:  Just want to address the “you have to press the charger plug in extra hard” comments from other reviews. Imagine you buy a brand new car and the dealer tells you that you need to use extra force when you close your door otherwise it will stay open and the car won’t run.  Are you going to be ok with that? Not me. And even if that’s the issue,  why didn’t support know it when I talked to them?  Also why is the battery at zero % therefore requiring the charger to power up? My replacement MSI worked perfectly right out of the box.",

                        "review":"I love this laptop, I push my laptop pretty hard, I use Blender, Daz3d and a few other software's for 3d modeling and rendering. this laptop can handle it pretty well. with blender cycles I could do optiX gpu rendering. in Daz Studio I was able to get a decent render using Nivdia iray with pretty good real time feed back. for games I was able to play Planetside 2 at a pretty good resolution at a good frame rate probably not like 120 fps on ulta high but it didnt dip below 30. with two m.2 drives on the bottom and a full ssd slot as well (cable is included so if you buy second hand watch out) I was able to get good storage. ram is upgradeable to 32 gbs which in the end is a pretty strong work horse. upgrading it was a bit scary as its not under the keyboard you have to take the bottom off and use a thin of plastic guitar pick or ifixit to open it up. go onto YouTube to watch a break down, its not to hard to upgrade. batter life is not great but you could tailor it by having it turn off lights and lower screen brightness. built in Bluetooth and full ethernet port 2 usb 3 ports and one usb c. which brings me to my con and that is very little vr support. I played vr games on a even older graphic card than this, and yet this RTX 3050 has no display port or a fast enough usb c to support an adapter. I cant say about the quest but I have a rift s and it will not work on this laptop.  if you are looking for a mid workstation laptop this might fill the bill, if you are looking to get this for an artist going into school this one would be a good deal with the dedicated gpu this will extend the life of this computer to be able to handle most 3d and 2d applications.Pros:great power for the costhas some room for upgradesok for 3d workok for gamingCons:limited VR Supportbattery life is kind of short",
