This includes anything related to why the blackout is happening. All posts about this and related topics will be redirected to this thread.\n\nBeing one of the largest communities on Reddit, we've had a ton of conversation about whether or not to keep the sub open and what our point of view is. Ultimately, we were led back to our core subreddit value of offering a neutral place to discuss topics that can be complex, challenging, and sometimes uncomfortable.\n\nWe've always done our best to be a neutral mod team because this subreddit is about letting the community discuss topics and at this moment in time, the community speaks louder than mods do. The mods here individually have our own opinions on the Reddit API controversy but as mods of a community dedicated to conversations, we think it's more impactful to keep the subreddit open so people can discuss this controversial change and the surrounding impacts.\n\nWe also want this thread to be a place of respectful discourse. Remember the human. Respect that other people can have different opinions. Please share your points of views and have open minded conversations with others. If you feel like you can't be respectful toward another user, consider not posting it.\n\n**For information on what exactly is going on:**\n\n[**BBC: Reddit blackout: Subreddits to go private on Monday**](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65855608)\n\nEdit: spelling, added link to the BBC article",

Shadowbanning is a practice where a user's actions and content are hidden from the public without their knowledge. This endpoint provides a way to detect if a user is affected by shadowbanning on Reddit.\n\nParameters:\n\nusername (string, optional): Specifies the username of the Reddit user to check for shadowbanning. The default value is set to \"John\".\nfull (boolean, optional): Determines whether additional user information should be returned in the response. If set to True, it includes details such as the user's join date, post karma, comment karma, and verified mail status. By default, it is set to False.\nproxy (string, optional): Specifies the proxy server to be used for the request. If required, you can provide the proxy server's details to route the request through a specific network or location. The default value is None, indicating no proxy is used.\ntimeout (integer, optional): Specifies the maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the Reddit API. The default timeout is set to 5 seconds.\nReturns:\n\nThe endpoint returns a JSON response with the following fields:\n\nis_shadowbanned (boolean): Indicates whether the specified Reddit user is shadowbanned. If True, the user is shadowbanned. If False, the user is not shadowbanned.\nIf full is set to True, the response also includes the following additional fields:\nusername (string): The username of the Reddit user.\njoin_date (string): The date and time when the user joined Reddit.\npost_karma (string): The amount of karma the user has gained from posting.\ncomment_karma (string): The amount of karma the user has gained from commenting.\nverified_mail (string): Indicates whether the user has a verified email associated with their account.\nError Handling:\n\nThe endpoint handles potential errors during the process. If the provided username is invalid, a ValueError is raised with an HTTPException status code of 400 and an error message indicating the issue.\n\nPossible errors during the request process, such as proxy connection failures, request timeouts, or internal server errors, are handled as HTTPExceptions with status codes 500 and appropriate error details.\n\nNote:\n\nThe endpoint utilizes the Reddit API to fetch information about the user.\nProper validation and handling of the username parameter are performed to ensure the input is valid and avoid potential errors.\nThe endpoint supports the usage of proxy servers for the request if required.\nThe timeout parameter allows controlling the maximum waiting time for the response from the Reddit API.\nThe endpoint provides basic information about the user and helps identify if they are shadowbanned on Reddit.",
