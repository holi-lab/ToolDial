            "description": "Submit a video for analysis.\nGet a json response with the assessments of the person's running posture and, if chosen to, pose estimates for each analyzed video frame.\n**Note** Do not use the \"Test Endpoint feature. It doesn't support the correct body `Content-Type` type - `multipart/form-data`. The video body parameter name should be `video.`\n\n## Example curl\nExample request can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/xgCYg49E)\n\n## Requirements\n - max video size is 50MB\n - the runner must be seen either from their left or right side. Back side support is coming soon.\n - the runner must be seen during the whole duration of the video. Users should crop it if otherwise.\n\n## Performance\nExpect the endpoint to take 2-3s for each second of video. A good timeout would be 60s.\n\n## Response fields\n\n### `assessments`\nArray of objects each containing an assessment for a trait.\nEach assessment contains:\n - `id`: string UUID of the assessment\n - `score`: integer, one of 0, 1 or 2.\n    - 0 - poor score\n    - 1 - adequate score\n    - 2 - excellent score\n - `trait` - string representing which trait is assessed. One of: `Running Cadence`, `Arm Swing`, `Arm Elbow Angle`, `Foot Strike`, `Stride`, `Vertical Bounce`, `Head Position`, `Hip Extension`\n - `value` - string with different underlying format depending on the trait as follows:\n    - `Running Cadence` - integer - the number of steps per minute\n    - `Arm Swing` - float - the median angle of swing in the shoulder\n    - `Arm Elbow Angle` - float - the median angle in the runner's elbow\n    - `Foot Strike` - one of `heel`, `mid foot`, `forefoot`, indicating which part of the foot touches the ground first\n    - `Stride` - one of `over`, `slightOver`, `normal`, indicating whether the runner is overstriding\n    - `Vertical Bounce` - integer - indicates how much the person's body is moving vertically. Since the actual length can not be determined just from video, the result is given as percent of torso length\n    - `Head Position` - one of `down`, `slightDown`, `neutral`\n    - `Hip Extension` - float - median degrees of hip extension\n - `slug` - short description of the evaluated trait, e.g. \"Your arms are at 74 degrees at the elbow\".\n - `description` - long description of the assessment. Contains an opinionated result of the runner's form. e.g. for value 2 for Arm Swing: `That's excellent and means you have great running dynamics.`\n\n### `totalScore`\nInteger between 0 and 100 scoring the runner's score based on the platform's opinion.\n\n### `estimates`\nArray of objects, each containing a 25-point pose estimate for a given video frame.\nEach object contains:\n - `time` - double - the time in the video of the frame\n - `estimate` - object\n   - `points`: object, each key is a point. One of: nose, leftEye, rightEye, leftEar, rightEar, leftShoulder, rightShoulder, leftElbow, rightElbow, leftWrist, rightWrist, leftHip, rightHip, leftKnee, rightKnee, leftAnkle, rightAnkle\n     - each point contains a `position` array. The first item is the `x` coordinate and the second - the `y`",
