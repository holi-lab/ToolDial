This should take no more than 15 mins.\n\nOnce it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and leave for additional 10 mins to cook the beans.\n\nRemove from heat and allow to cool down naturally to depressurize. This should take around 20 mins. You can speed this up by running the top of the pot under a cold water tap for about 3 mins. Please note that I am referring to stove top pressure cooker here and not electric pressure cooker.\n\nOnce the pot is adequately cooled. Unlock the lid and check the beans, you want it to be tender already with a little bite so it can be cooked with the rice.\n\nPour the beans with the cooking liquid and the waakye leaves into another pot. Wash the rice and pour into the pot too.\n\nAdd more water if needed so there is enough to cook the rice. Add some salt and cover the pot.\n\nAllow the rice to cook. The time for this depends on the type of rice used. .\n\nTake out the waakye leaves and serve with your favourite side.",

When it gets cold, please pour fresh cow milk and mix them together.\n\n    You can also use milk powder mix with water to form a milk drink and then add your cooked millet to it.
