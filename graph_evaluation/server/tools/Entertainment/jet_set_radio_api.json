                        "In the English JSRF manual, DJ Professor K describes him as \"the mysterious kid that appeared in the streets of Tokyo.\" The Japanese JSRF manual calls him \"enigmatic\" and states he's an overconfident kind of guy who doesn't care for trivialities.",
                        "Beat looks similar to his Jet Set Radio counterpart in Jet Set Radio Future, donning a yellow shirt and black pants. However, in this game his shirt is more of a yellowish-green and has black shoulders, he wears solid dark blue goggles, and there are long spikes or antennae that point outwards from the ears of his gray headphones. His skates are black and gray with light blue katakana spelling his name (ビート) down the front, as well as yellow wheels. In addition, he wears full black gloves as opposed to the fingerless variant his counterpart wore. His hair is burgundy and cut short. His name is also written in blue katakana on the front of his shirt, and there's a stylised record on the back.",
                        "In Jet Set Radio, Beat was the leader of the GG's, but in JSRF this role is taken by Corn. Beat is a lone Rudie first encountered at Dogenzaka Hill. He is suspected of stealing the Goddess of Dogenzaka Hill, causing the blackout at 99th Street and is referred to as a \"low-life\" and a \"rumor-spreading scumbag\". He challenges whichever GG encounters him to a race around Dogenzaka Hill. After you have beaten him, the police will appear, and Beat will join the GG's and hide out in the Garage. From this point onwards, Beat becomes a playable character.",
                        "He seems to have an interest in taking over as the leader of the GG's, a reference to his leader status in Jet Set Radio. When confronted in Dogenzaka Hill, he will challenge Corn to gain the leadership of the GG's, as opposed to just the ownership of the turf when spoken to by Gum or Yoyo. If the player talks to him in the garage after he joins but before fighting the police, he will ask about Pots and then taunt the current GG talking to him by asking: \"You sure that's not the leader in disguse? Heh heh.\" and ending the dialouge with: \"It's only a matter of time before I become the leader of GG's anyway.\"",
                        "Near the end of the game, the GG's are confronted with Zero Beat, robotic copies of the original created by Gouji Rokkaku that stand in their way.",
                        "Beat, as he appears in Jet Set Radio Future, is a playable character in this Sega racing game. He drives an orange and red customized street racer called \"De la GG's,\" named after his gang. It has an built-in stereo system and neon underlights. In his \"All Star Move\", he ditches his car and skates ahead at an incredible speed. He can also spraypaint opponents' windshields."

Her white outfit is replaced by a low cut skin-tight, midriff baring orange top, with dark grey sleeves which have katakana characters going down them. There are yellow stars over her nipple area and between her shoulder blades. Her pants are also orange and snug fitting, ending in a flare just below the knee. There are what appears to be yellow pouches strapped to either hip, and a yellow trim to her pants.

You must reach and talk to her before time runs out, at which point she'll say that you're pretty good and will join you. You are given 20 seconds to reach her. To do so, you must grind and make a few jumps, otherwise it is impossible to reach her in time. If you do not make it in time, she jumps off the ramp behind her and grinds away, not to be seen again unless you trigger her appearance again."

He himself uses a large revolver to take out gang members. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he hates young people, and that may be the case because of some past trauma. When the Golden Rhino's show up, DJ Professor K specifically says in a cutscene that the police force was \"too scared to take on the Golden Rhino's\". This may be why Onishima does not appear again after chapter 1.",

His pants are brown and he typically carries an oversized revolver, which parodies -as does the whole character- Clint Eastwood's character Harry 'Dirty Harry' Callahan, from the eponymous film series. Like the rest of him, Onishima's hair looks unkempt and greasy. Ironically, his hairstyle is usually associated with delinquents in Japan. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he is exactly 5 feet tall."

A while after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls; DJ Professor K will stop telling you where Clutch is headed. Clutch then disappears from the game and you need to start over. To stop this from happening, save your game right after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls. Clutch does not have to skate from location to location through the map; he just appears, so when you are following him you must be fast. He stays in different places for different time intervals which are listed above so his appearance is perfectly predictable. Ignoring what DJ Professor K says won't help despite what people say. The DJ tells you every time Clutch enters an area, so he is somewhat helpful. Here's the catch; if you go to the area that the DJ tells you that Clutch is in, by the time you get there Clutch will be gone. The area DJ Professor K tells you, you must go to the area that Clutch is going to next in the pattern: Kibogaoka Hill, The Skyscraper District and Pharaoh Park, and then Chuo Street. If you are in any of these places, wait until he appear in the exact places in the areas mentioned in \"Acquiring Clutch\"."

His skates are a matching grey and black, with teal wheels. There is white katakana placed vertically on his right shirt sleeve that spells out his name, Combo (コンボ).

Vertical katakana adorn the front, just under her cleavage, flanked on either side by three aqua coloured short horizontal bars stacked vertically. Between her shoulder blades is a blue-grey cross, and there is a similarly coloured patch at the base of her spine. She wears thin dark grey armbands around her upper arms, and wristbands which mirror the collar of her dress, as well as a dark grey choker. Her trademark helmet remains virtually the same compared to her counterpart in Jet Set Radio. It has a blue-grey colour, with what appears to be built in headphones, but these ones are light grey in the center, with an orange ring where they meet the body of the helmet. Her skates mirror the helmet in colour, and have a blue grey cross on an aqua field within a lighter grey circle on both sides of each skate, with yellow wheels.",

He raids the stadium before you can win your last game of Death Ball against the Love Shockers, and returns with the Terror Drone once again, but he attacks differently here. However, your strategy is still the game. There are shockwaves the Terror Drone creates that you have to jump over, and then grind on the legs and spray just like before.",
                        "After his last defeat the Stadium, Hayashi is fired from the Rokakku Police force, for his inability to stop you 6 times in a row and twice in a row with the giant Terror Drone. This is when the Golden Rhinos replace him and the Rokakku Police grunts.",
                        "While he always tries to stop the GG's and works for Gouji Rokkaku, Hayashi doesn't have a direct personal comment with anyone. There are however many times other characters talk about him:"

In Jet Set Radio they are only a group of three, however in Jet Set Radio Future they are led by a female leader, the former head of Rapid 99. The leader's switch to becoming a Poison Jam leader has resulted in a bitter rivalry between the two.

The Poison Jam gets kidnapped after the Tag Battle by a black limousine. They are not heard from again until near the end of the game, where their masks are gone, and they are under mind control of the Golden Rhinos.

Entertain me\", and makes the player race him around Highway Zero.

This can be quite the blessing, as having to deal with both paratroopers and tanks at the same time would have been quite tiring. The one stage exempt from this is Shibuya GG, since when the second stage of response happens, it being Captain Onishima, the normal police will not leave the stage.",

Normal police officers wouldn’t appear in Park Street, instead the motorcycle police and SWAT team would be there instead. And police don’t appear in Center Street at all in the final game.",

The cutscene shown would eventually be used by the police response in the Bus Terminal in the stage Shibuya GG. In the final game, the only appearance of normal officers in Kogane-Cho is in the starting intro of the stage The Monster of Kogane.",

There are two different army mentions, one talking about them entering Kogane-Cho, and one about them entering Benten-Cho. But other the the location names, the army lines are the same.",
                        "There were two version of each line, one for with the Japanese terms, and one with English. This brings some interesting points on what the police and SWAT teams are actually called in game, as the cut lines have him both calling them the “police” and “SWAT”, but also “keisatsu(警察)” and “kidoutai(機動隊)” respectively. Also, these lines have him talk about the army, or “Jieitai(自衛隊)”, as though they are a separate entity form the police. And while this is very much true in real life, it’s never clearly defined in the final game whether or not the Parachute Squad, Attack Helicopters and Tanks are owned by the police or the military."

Her once dark brown hair is now blonde, held back with a blue headband, which allows her ponytail of long curls to dangle freely. Her white outfit is replaced by a low cut skin-tight, midriff baring orange top, with dark grey sleeves which have katakana characters going down them. There are yellow stars over her nipple area and between her shoulder blades. Her pants are also orange and snug fitting, ending in a flare just below the knee. There are what appears to be yellow pouches strapped to either hip, and a yellow trim to her pants. Her gloves have since become two toned blue/blue grey, as have her skates, which now sport red wheels.",

As soon as you enter the area with stairs before the large power lines, Boogie will appear at the top of the structure and a timer will start. You must reach and talk to her before time runs out, at which point she'll say that you're pretty good and will join you. You are given 20 seconds to reach her. To do so, you must grind and make a few jumps, otherwise it is impossible to reach her in time. If you do not make it in time, she jumps off the ramp behind her and grinds away, not to be seen again unless you trigger her appearance again."

He himself uses a large revolver to take out gang members. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he hates young people, and that may be the case because of some past trauma. When the Golden Rhino's show up, DJ Professor K specifically says in a cutscene that the police force was \"too scared to take on the Golden Rhino's\". This may be why Onishima does not appear again after chapter 1.",

His pants are brown and he typically carries an oversized revolver, which parodies -as does the whole character- Clint Eastwood's character Harry 'Dirty Harry' Callahan, from the eponymous film series. Like the rest of him, Onishima's hair looks unkempt and greasy. Ironically, his hairstyle is usually associated with delinquents in Japan. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he is exactly 5 feet tall."

A while after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls; DJ Professor K will stop telling you where Clutch is headed. Clutch then disappears from the game and you need to start over. To stop this from happening, save your game right after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls. Clutch does not have to skate from location to location through the map; he just appears, so when you are following him you must be fast. He stays in different places for different time intervals which are listed above so his appearance is perfectly predictable. Ignoring what DJ Professor K says won't help despite what people say. The DJ tells you every time Clutch enters an area, so he is somewhat helpful. Here's the catch; if you go to the area that the DJ tells you that Clutch is in, by the time you get there Clutch will be gone. The area DJ Professor K tells you, you must go to the area that Clutch is going to next in the pattern: Kibogaoka Hill, The Skyscraper District and Pharaoh Park, and then Chuo Street. If you are in any of these places, wait until he appear in the exact places in the areas mentioned in \"Acquiring Clutch\"."

In the English Jet Set Radio Future manual, DJ Professor K describes her as \"a perverse lady with the tendency to abandon a guy in 10 minutes after winning his heart.\" In the Japanese JSRF manual, she's said to hold the gang together alongside Corn and appears to be more \"calm and composed\" than him. She is also lewd with a tendency of abandoning guys within 10 minutes of seducing them. The official Japanese JSRF website states she is a \"bad judge of character\".",

Vertical katakana adorn the front, just under her cleavage, flanked on either side by three aqua coloured short horizontal bars stacked vertically. Between her shoulder blades is a blue-grey cross, and there is a similarly coloured patch at the base of her spine. She wears thin dark grey armbands around her upper arms, and wristbands which mirror the collar of her dress, as well as a dark grey choker. Her trademark helmet remains virtually the same compared to her counterpart in Jet Set Radio. It has a blue-grey colour, with what appears to be built in headphones, but these ones are light grey in the center, with an orange ring where they meet the body of the helmet. Her skates mirror the helmet in colour, and have a blue grey cross on an aqua field within a lighter grey circle on both sides of each skate, with yellow wheels.",

Hayashi could be considered insane, as he often laughs manically, or uses untested experimental weapons which could go horribly wrong.",
                        "His appearances are often with a team of Rokkaku Police with him. Both Hayashi and the squads must be knocked down and sprayed to be defeated, but Hayashi generally has a much larger life bar.",

He raids the stadium before you can win your last game of Death Ball against the Love Shockers, and returns with the Terror Drone once again, but he attacks differently here. However, your strategy is still the game. There are shockwaves the Terror Drone creates that you have to jump over, and then grind on the legs and spray just like before.",

After the GG's defeat the Doom Riders, the Immortals, and almost the Love Shockers, Captain Hayashi interferes in the competition with an upgraded Terror Drone. Jazz and the player go their seperate ways, and the player defeats Hayashi alone.

They are depicted as gore movie buffs, and are all rather large. In Jet Set Radio they are only a group of three, however in Jet Set Radio Future they are led by a female leader, the former head of Rapid 99. The leader's switch to becoming a Poison Jam leader has resulted in a bitter rivalry between the two. Poison Jam mostly sticks around the Kogane-Cho area and rarely ventures out of that particular area. In both games Poison Jam is known as a nuisance.",

If done so many times, Poison Jam fills the GG's headquarters with frogs. The frogs eventually leave on their own as the story progresses. The Poison Jam gets kidnapped after the Tag Battle by a black limousine. They are not heard from again until near the end of the game, where their masks are gone, and they are under mind control of the Golden Rhinos. After being defeated, they tell the GG's all of Gouji's plan. They are mentioned once more in the epilogue as being back on the streets in full health.",

They are first seen upon the player's first arrival at Shibuya Terminal and have sprayed their purple graffiti everywhere. It is revealed later that their graffiti contains a poison that make people laugh themselves to death. They appear for a quick follow-the-leader session after after all of their graffiti has been sprayed, then leave for Chuo Street, where they sprayed more graffiti and must be raced. Presumably they are responsible for the record store attack DJ Professor K mentions in his first broadcast.",

They have retreated to the Bottom Point of Sewage Facility, where their then-leader Cube makes the player and Poison Jam play a Tagger's Tag around the area.",

They further add to their monster theme with scaled gloves fashioned to look like claws. They wear grey coveralls with one strap, and have the legs cut off just below the knee, under which they sport a black t-shirt with the kanji 毒 on the shoulder.",

The mask has been redesigned to cover only the face, showing off a bright green mohawk, with the creature's open mouth again serving as the only opening. The overalls are black, with both straps, and rather than being cut off at the knee, they are now neatly cuffed, with vertical the katakana 毒 on the front chest in bright green. The t-shirt has been replaced with a black long sleeve shirt worn under the blue green scale suit. With the addition of spikes to the arm guards, the straps and cuffs of the overalls, as well as a red rounded shoulder piece which itself has three large spikes, their appearance is significantly more sinister this time around.",

She retains her blue hair, her headphones, and her blue lip colour, but her outfit is a lot racier: a light blue backless dress with a high collar, with a thin strapped bra with red and grey cups on the outside. The hem is a darker blue grey, above which part of her name (リズ) is written in contrasting blue katakana. On her arms, she wears full length, loose transparent sleeves tightened around her biceps, with a black and yellow wristband on her left wrist. Her panties are a light yellow, and her stockings have been replaced by blue and blue-grey knee socks. Her skates, trimmed with white fur, are predominantly aqua coloured, with light blue markings, blue grey, and a bit of yellow. There are black and white striped spikes on the heels, and the wheels are black and yellow.",

Aside from that, her role is minimal."

They're the official Police department of Tokyo and their duty is to enforce the law and protect the innocent. They can usually be destroyed by knocking them over and then spraying them on the floor. They can grab your back and hang on to you until you lose health, but you can shake them off. They are normally led by Captain Onishima in Jet Set Radio and Hayashi in Jet Set Radio Future.",
                        "The police force are willing to send various destructive weapons and attacks at the GG's, indicating the gang to be a large-scale problem to the police for unknown reasons beyond graffiti. Attack helicopters, SWAT team members, and tanks are some of the few armaments that are authorized to face the GG's, all of which fail to capture the nimble street gang.",

Appearing in the first chapter only, after which they are replaced by the Golden Rhinos for the rest of the game. Led by Captain Onishima they are quite troublesome for new players. They are in charge of law enforcement and the protection of the innocent and property in Tokyo-To.",
                        "After the Rokkaku Group and the Metropolitan Government worked together to create the 21st Century Project, the police started to use quite extreme methods in order to stop and arrest the gangs of Rudies. Ranging from more reasonable and standard means such as normal officers and police dogs, to the completely over the top such as paratroopers and tanks!",
                        "There are two levels of police response in each stage. The first level usually consist of easy to deal with enemies, while the second will be harder more dangerous enemies. Depending on stage, the first level of police response will be quite hard anyway.",
                        "The police responses of each stage is dependent on the amount of red arrowed graffiti sprayed. After reaching a certain amount the police scanner will chime in with either police HQ or Onishima, they will convey a short message which will describe the units responding. The Next tag the player sprays will actually trigger the response, which shows a short cutscene of the units entering the stage.",
                        "Once the second stage of the police response starts, the first stage will no longer be in the stage. Meaning that, for instance, in Graffiti High, once the Tanks arrive, the Parachute Squad will leave. This can be quite the blessing, as having to deal with both paratroopers and tanks at the same time would have been quite tiring. The one stage exempt from this is Shibuya GG, since when the second stage of response happens, it being Captain Onishima, the normal police will not leave the stage.",
                        "In various points of each stage, there are escape points, which are predetermined paths that, if the player uses them, will automatically make them escape the police.",
                        "Escape points will be highlighted by blue arrows, and after the police start giving chase, an arrow at the top of the screen will point to the nearest one.",

There are even cut sound files found in the game of him referring to them by their English terms “police”, and slang term “cops”, making the reason for him to refer them in a different language even more baffling.",
                        "In the original trailer for the Dreamcast release shows normal police officers in both the Center Street and Park Street areas of Shibuya-Cho. Normal police officers wouldn’t appear in Park Street, instead the motorcycle police and SWAT team would be there instead. And police don’t appear in Center Street at all in the final game.",
                        "The trailer also shows normal police officers responding in the Residential Area of Kogane-Cho. The cutscene shown would eventually be used by the police response in the Bus Terminal in the stage Shibuya GG. In the final game, the only appearance of normal officers in Kogane-Cho is in the starting intro of the stage The Monster of Kogane.",
                        "Police were also shown swinging their batons at the player while chasing them in the trailer. It’s unknown whether it would’ve done damage, though, it can be assumed it did.",
                        "Found in the game’s files are cut sound clips of various DJ Professor K lines talking about the police. These would’ve acted as ways of telling the player what enemies they would be going up against in the next stages.",
                        "The sound files include him talking about the normal police, the SWAT team, and the army. There are two different army mentions, one talking about them entering Kogane-Cho, and one about them entering Benten-Cho. But other the the location names, the army lines are the same.",
                        "There were two version of each line, one for with the Japanese terms, and one with English. This brings some interesting points on what the police and SWAT teams are actually called in game, as the cut lines have him both calling them the “police” and “SWAT”, but also “keisatsu(警察)” and “kidoutai(機動隊)” respectively. Also, these lines have him talk about the army, or “Jieitai(自衛隊)”, as though they are a separate entity form the police. And while this is very much true in real life, it’s never clearly defined in the final game whether or not the Parachute Squad, Attack Helicopters and Tanks are owned by the police or the military."

However, in this game his shirt is more of a yellowish-green and has black shoulders, he wears solid dark blue goggles, and there are long spikes or antennae that point outwards from the ears of his gray headphones. His skates are black and gray with light blue katakana spelling his name (ビート) down the front, as well as yellow wheels. In addition, he wears full black gloves as opposed to the fingerless variant his counterpart wore. His hair is burgundy and cut short. His name is also written in blue katakana on the front of his shirt, and there's a stylised record on the back.",

He is suspected of stealing the Goddess of Dogenzaka Hill, causing the blackout at 99th Street and is referred to as a \"low-life\" and a \"rumor-spreading scumbag\". He challenges whichever GG encounters him to a race around Dogenzaka Hill. After you have beaten him, the police will appear, and Beat will join the GG's and hide out in the Garage. From this point onwards, Beat becomes a playable character.",
                        "He seems to have an interest in taking over as the leader of the GG's, a reference to his leader status in Jet Set Radio. When confronted in Dogenzaka Hill, he will challenge Corn to gain the leadership of the GG's, as opposed to just the ownership of the turf when spoken to by Gum or Yoyo. If the player talks to him in the garage after he joins but before fighting the police, he will ask about Pots and then taunt the current GG talking to him by asking: \"You sure that's not the leader in disguse? Heh heh.\" and ending the dialouge with: \"It's only a matter of time before I become the leader of GG's anyway.\"",
                        "Near the end of the game, the GG's are confronted with Zero Beat, robotic copies of the original created by Gouji Rokkaku that stand in their way.",

He drives an orange and red customized street racer called \"De la GG's,\" named after his gang. It has an built-in stereo system and neon underlights. In his \"All Star Move\", he ditches his car and skates ahead at an incredible speed. He can also spraypaint opponents' windshields."

Her once dark brown hair is now blonde, held back with a blue headband, which allows her ponytail of long curls to dangle freely. Her white outfit is replaced by a low cut skin-tight, midriff baring orange top, with dark grey sleeves which have katakana characters going down them. There are yellow stars over her nipple area and between her shoulder blades. Her pants are also orange and snug fitting, ending in a flare just below the knee. There are what appears to be yellow pouches strapped to either hip, and a yellow trim to her pants. Her gloves have since become two toned blue/blue grey, as have her skates, which now sport red wheels.",

As soon as you enter the area with stairs before the large power lines, Boogie will appear at the top of the structure and a timer will start. You must reach and talk to her before time runs out, at which point she'll say that you're pretty good and will join you. You are given 20 seconds to reach her. To do so, you must grind and make a few jumps, otherwise it is impossible to reach her in time. If you do not make it in time, she jumps off the ramp behind her and grinds away, not to be seen again unless you trigger her appearance again."

A while after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls; DJ Professor K will stop telling you where Clutch is headed. Clutch then disappears from the game and you need to start over. To stop this from happening, save your game right after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls. Clutch does not have to skate from location to location through the map; he just appears, so when you are following him you must be fast. He stays in different places for different time intervals which are listed above so his appearance is perfectly predictable. Ignoring what DJ Professor K says won't help despite what people say. The DJ tells you every time Clutch enters an area, so he is somewhat helpful. Here's the catch; if you go to the area that the DJ tells you that Clutch is in, by the time you get there Clutch will be gone. The area DJ Professor K tells you, you must go to the area that Clutch is going to next in the pattern: Kibogaoka Hill, The Skyscraper District and Pharaoh Park, and then Chuo Street. If you are in any of these places, wait until he appear in the exact places in the areas mentioned in \"Acquiring Clutch\"."

However, in this game his shirt is more of a yellowish-green and has black shoulders, he wears solid dark blue goggles, and there are long spikes or antennae that point outwards from the ears of his gray headphones. His skates are black and gray with light blue katakana spelling his name (ビート) down the front, as well as yellow wheels. In addition, he wears full black gloves as opposed to the fingerless variant his counterpart wore. His hair is burgundy and cut short. His name is also written in blue katakana on the front of his shirt, and there's a stylised record on the back.",
                        "In Jet Set Radio, Beat was the leader of the GG's, but in JSRF this role is taken by Corn. Beat is a lone Rudie first encountered at Dogenzaka Hill. He is suspected of stealing the Goddess of Dogenzaka Hill, causing the blackout at 99th Street and is referred to as a \"low-life\" and a \"rumor-spreading scumbag\". He challenges whichever GG encounters him to a race around Dogenzaka Hill. After you have beaten him, the police will appear, and Beat will join the GG's and hide out in the Garage. From this point onwards, Beat becomes a playable character.",
                        "He seems to have an interest in taking over as the leader of the GG's, a reference to his leader status in Jet Set Radio. When confronted in Dogenzaka Hill, he will challenge Corn to gain the leadership of the GG's, as opposed to just the ownership of the turf when spoken to by Gum or Yoyo. If the player talks to him in the garage after he joins but before fighting the police, he will ask about Pots and then taunt the current GG talking to him by asking: \"You sure that's not the leader in disguse? Heh heh.\" and ending the dialouge with: \"It's only a matter of time before I become the leader of GG's anyway.\"",
                        "Near the end of the game, the GG's are confronted with Zero Beat, robotic copies of the original created by Gouji Rokkaku that stand in their way.",

He drives an orange and red customized street racer called \"De la GG's,\" named after his gang. It has an built-in stereo system and neon underlights. In his \"All Star Move\", he ditches his car and skates ahead at an incredible speed. He can also spraypaint opponents' windshields."

Her once dark brown hair is now blonde, held back with a blue headband, which allows her ponytail of long curls to dangle freely. Her white outfit is replaced by a low cut skin-tight, midriff baring orange top, with dark grey sleeves which have katakana characters going down them. There are yellow stars over her nipple area and between her shoulder blades. Her pants are also orange and snug fitting, ending in a flare just below the knee. There are what appears to be yellow pouches strapped to either hip, and a yellow trim to her pants. Her gloves have since become two toned blue/blue grey, as have her skates, which now sport red wheels.",

You must reach and talk to her before time runs out, at which point she'll say that you're pretty good and will join you. You are given 20 seconds to reach her. To do so, you must grind and make a few jumps, otherwise it is impossible to reach her in time. If you do not make it in time, she jumps off the ramp behind her and grinds away, not to be seen again unless you trigger her appearance again."

He himself uses a large revolver to take out gang members. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he hates young people, and that may be the case because of some past trauma. When the Golden Rhino's show up, DJ Professor K specifically says in a cutscene that the police force was \"too scared to take on the Golden Rhino's\". This may be why Onishima does not appear again after chapter 1.",

Like the rest of him, Onishima's hair looks unkempt and greasy. Ironically, his hairstyle is usually associated with delinquents in Japan. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he is exactly 5 feet tall."

A while after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls; DJ Professor K will stop telling you where Clutch is headed. Clutch then disappears from the game and you need to start over. To stop this from happening, save your game right after Clutch takes away your Graffiti Souls. Clutch does not have to skate from location to location through the map; he just appears, so when you are following him you must be fast. He stays in different places for different time intervals which are listed above so his appearance is perfectly predictable. Ignoring what DJ Professor K says won't help despite what people say. The DJ tells you every time Clutch enters an area, so he is somewhat helpful. Here's the catch; if you go to the area that the DJ tells you that Clutch is in, by the time you get there Clutch will be gone. The area DJ Professor K tells you, you must go to the area that Clutch is going to next in the pattern: Kibogaoka Hill, The Skyscraper District and Pharaoh Park, and then Chuo Street. If you are in any of these places, wait until he appear in the exact places in the areas mentioned in \"Acquiring Clutch\"."

He's the commander of the Rokakku Police Force, and is often seen carrying a gun (a cartoonish Walther P1). He has white hair, white gloves, and a dark blue coat with a high collar. Hayashi could be considered insane, as he often laughs manically, or uses untested experimental weapons which could go horribly wrong.",
                        "His appearances are often with a team of Rokkaku Police with him. Both Hayashi and the squads must be knocked down and sprayed to be defeated, but Hayashi generally has a much larger life bar.",
                        "As explained at the beginning of Chapter 2, he is angered easily and doesn't seem to get enough sleep. In DJ Professor K's second broadcast, he mentions how Hayashi once trashed a patrol car because one of his lackeys brought him coffee-flavoured candy instead of his favourite mint flavour.",

                        "Near the end of the level, where you spray the final few graffiti, Hayashi will show up with some armored troops which require a Boost Dash to knock down.",

He raids the stadium before you can win your last game of Death Ball against the Love Shockers, and returns with the Terror Drone once again, but he attacks differently here. However, your strategy is still the game. There are shockwaves the Terror Drone creates that you have to jump over, and then grind on the legs and spray just like before.",

The Poison Jam gets kidnapped after the Tag Battle by a black limousine. They are not heard from again until near the end of the game, where their masks are gone, and they are under mind control of the Golden Rhinos. After being defeated, they tell the GG's all of Gouji's plan. They are mentioned once more in the epilogue as being back on the streets in full health.",
                        "Poison Jam is the first real rival gang faced in Jet Set Radio Future. They are first seen upon the player's first arrival at Shibuya Terminal and have sprayed their purple graffiti everywhere. It is revealed later that their graffiti contains a poison that make people laugh themselves to death. They appear for a quick follow-the-leader session after after all of their graffiti has been sprayed, then leave for Chuo Street, where they sprayed more graffiti and must be raced. Presumably they are responsible for the record store attack DJ Professor K mentions in his first broadcast.",
                        "They next appear in Rokkaku-dai Heights, along with more graffiti. This is the last time in the game that the player will have to cover up Poison Jam graffiti. When encountered here and followed around for a little while, they leave for the then-inaccessible Tokyo Underground Sewage Facility. They have retreated to the Bottom Point of Sewage Facility, where their then-leader Cube makes the player and Poison Jam play a Tagger's Tag around the area.",
                        "Poison Jam is encountered only once more after the Tagger's Tag. In the Skyscraper District, Poison Jam remains near the rail line. He tells the player that Yoyo was seen heading to Sky Dinosaurian Square. From there the player head there to discover the secret about \"Yoyo\".",
                        "If the player talks to Beat in Chapter 3, he will ask about a rumor he heard about Poison Jam causing trouble in Chuo Street under a different time sometime ago is true.",
                        "Poison Jam's outfits in Jet Set Radio mimic a Godzilla-style reptilian creature, with its head serving as a mask which covers the head and face, using the mouth as an opening, and appear to be numbered. They further add to their monster theme with scaled gloves fashioned to look like claws. They wear grey coveralls with one strap, and have the legs cut off just below the knee, under which they sport a black t-shirt with the kanji 毒 on the shoulder.",
                        "In Jet Set Radio Future, they undergo a major change, though they keep their reptilian theme. The mask has been redesigned to cover only the face, showing off a bright green mohawk, with the creature's open mouth again serving as the only opening. The overalls are black, with both straps, and rather than being cut off at the knee, they are now neatly cuffed, with vertical the katakana 毒 on the front chest in bright green. The t-shirt has been replaced with a black long sleeve shirt worn under the blue green scale suit. With the addition of spikes to the arm guards, the straps and cuffs of the overalls, as well as a red rounded shoulder piece which itself has three large spikes, their appearance is significantly more sinister this time around.",
                        "Successfully complete all Kogane-cho levels with a \"Jet\" rank to unlock the Poison Jam gang.",
                        "Achieve a Jet ranking in Test Run mode at the Tokyo Underground Sewage Facility as well as the Bottom Point of Sewage Facility."

He then wears a dark yellow vest with a dark blue long sleeve undershirt with white studs around the wrists, dark yellow shorts, and a studded black belt with a white star emblem on the front.

They're the official Police department of Tokyo and their duty is to enforce the law and protect the innocent. They can usually be destroyed by knocking them over and then spraying them on the floor. They can grab your back and hang on to you until you lose health, but you can shake them off. They are normally led by Captain Onishima in Jet Set Radio and Hayashi in Jet Set Radio Future.",
                        "The police force are willing to send various destructive weapons and attacks at the GG's, indicating the gang to be a large-scale problem to the police for unknown reasons beyond graffiti. Attack helicopters, SWAT team members, and tanks are some of the few armaments that are authorized to face the GG's, all of which fail to capture the nimble street gang.",
                        "The Tokyo-to police force in Jet Set Radio are the main enemies you encounter at the start of the game. Appearing in the first chapter only, after which they are replaced by the Golden Rhinos for the rest of the game. Led by Captain Onishima they are quite troublesome for new players. They are in charge of law enforcement and the protection of the innocent and property in Tokyo-To.",
                        "After the Rokkaku Group and the Metropolitan Government worked together to create the 21st Century Project, the police started to use quite extreme methods in order to stop and arrest the gangs of Rudies. Ranging from more reasonable and standard means such as normal officers and police dogs, to the completely over the top such as paratroopers and tanks!",
                        "There are two levels of police response in each stage. The first level usually consist of easy to deal with enemies, while the second will be harder more dangerous enemies. Depending on stage, the first level of police response will be quite hard anyway.",
                        "The police responses of each stage is dependent on the amount of red arrowed graffiti sprayed. After reaching a certain amount the police scanner will chime in with either police HQ or Onishima, they will convey a short message which will describe the units responding. The Next tag the player sprays will actually trigger the response, which shows a short cutscene of the units entering the stage.",
                        "Once the second stage of the police response starts, the first stage will no longer be in the stage. Meaning that, for instance, in Graffiti High, once the Tanks arrive, the Parachute Squad will leave. This can be quite the blessing, as having to deal with both paratroopers and tanks at the same time would have been quite tiring. The one stage exempt from this is Shibuya GG, since when the second stage of response happens, it being Captain Onishima, the normal police will not leave the stage.",
                        "In various points of each stage, there are escape points, which are predetermined paths that, if the player uses them, will automatically make them escape the police.",
                        "Escape points will be highlighted by blue arrows, and after the police start giving chase, an arrow at the top of the screen will point to the nearest one.",
                        "If the player escapes the police through an escape point, a short cutscene shows the police officers catching their breath or stomping their foot while venting frustration at losing the player.",

                        "In the English versions of the game, DJ Professor K will still refer to the police by their Japanese name, “keisatsu(警察)”, for unknown reasons. There are even cut sound files found in the game of him referring to them by their English terms “police”, and slang term “cops”, making the reason for him to refer them in a different language even more baffling.",
                        "In the original trailer for the Dreamcast release shows normal police officers in both the Center Street and Park Street areas of Shibuya-Cho. Normal police officers wouldn’t appear in Park Street, instead the motorcycle police and SWAT team would be there instead. And police don’t appear in Center Street at all in the final game.",
                        "The trailer also shows normal police officers responding in the Residential Area of Kogane-Cho. The cutscene shown would eventually be used by the police response in the Bus Terminal in the stage Shibuya GG. In the final game, the only appearance of normal officers in Kogane-Cho is in the starting intro of the stage The Monster of Kogane.",
                        "Police were also shown swinging their batons at the player while chasing them in the trailer. It’s unknown whether it would’ve done damage, though, it can be assumed it did.",
                        "Found in the game’s files are cut sound clips of various DJ Professor K lines talking about the police. These would’ve acted as ways of telling the player what enemies they would be going up against in the next stages.",
                        "The sound files include him talking about the normal police, the SWAT team, and the army. There are two different army mentions, one talking about them entering Kogane-Cho, and one about them entering Benten-Cho. But other the the location names, the army lines are the same.",
                        "There were two version of each line, one for with the Japanese terms, and one with English. This brings some interesting points on what the police and SWAT teams are actually called in game, as the cut lines have him both calling them the “police” and “SWAT”, but also “keisatsu(警察)” and “kidoutai(機動隊)” respectively. Also, these lines have him talk about the army, or “Jieitai(自衛隊)”, as though they are a separate entity form the police. And while this is very much true in real life, it’s never clearly defined in the final game whether or not the Parachute Squad, Attack Helicopters and Tanks are owned by the police or the military."

He himself uses a large revolver to take out gang members. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he hates young people, and that may be the case because of some past trauma. When the Golden Rhino's show up, DJ Professor K specifically says in a cutscene that the police force was \"too scared to take on the Golden Rhino's\". This may be why Onishima does not appear again after chapter 1.",

His pants are brown and he typically carries an oversized revolver, which parodies -as does the whole character- Clint Eastwood's character Harry 'Dirty Harry' Callahan, from the eponymous film series. Like the rest of him, Onishima's hair looks unkempt and greasy. Ironically, his hairstyle is usually associated with delinquents in Japan. According to the Jet Grind Radio manual, he is exactly 5 feet tall."
