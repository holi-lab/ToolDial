The global reach of the United Nations makes it not only the most representative intergovernmental body on earth, but also the world\u2019s best hope for peace and security, sustainable development and the promotion and protection of human rights and social progress. Its membership, drawn from all corners of the globe, gives it the legitimacy that enables it to speak authoritatively as the voice and conscience of the international community, and to take on complex and daunting global challenges\u2014from intra- and inter-State armed conflicts to natural disasters and massive population displacement\u2014, in the service of humanity.  In accordance with the provisions of its Charter, the United Nations is committed to human progress and the preservation of the environment\u2014our collective home. As we all know, our primary mandate, as prescribed in Article 1 of the Charter, is to \u201cmaintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace\u201d. In this noble undertaking, cooperation, collaboration, unity and solidarity must be the light we should seek and follow.  To its credit, the United Nations has championed human progress on many fronts, including peace operations, human rights, non-discrimination, decolonization, gender equality and sustainable development. The Organization has also supported regional and subregional organizations in initiatives such as the African Union Agenda 2063. The Organization also continues to collaborate with other intergovernmental organizations and civil society in furtherance of its disarmament agenda and in tackling international terrorism, human trafficking, toxic waste dumping, and combating deadly diseases and health pandemics. The Sustainable Development Goals, launched in 2015, as well as the Paris Climate Agreement, capped the Organization\u2019s list of achievements in recent years.  Of course, tension over norms and methods and policy differences have also marked exchanges and deliberations in the Organization, sometimes blocking meaningful action when it is most critical. Indeed, some of the more difficult and long-lasting matters of war and peace play out here in the United Nations, quite often pitting countries against each other and getting in the way of the coherent operation of the main organs and other entities of the United Nations.  As the most representative of the Organization\u2019s main organs, the General Assembly is a unique forum for promoting multilateralism in the full spectrum of international issues before the Organization. It must never relent in its efforts to bridge gaps and act for the common good. No matter the gravity of the challenge, we are most likely to prevail when all parties work together. Facilitating this will be my foremost objective.  In particular, we must continue efforts to strengthen the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, based on the principle of mutual understanding and respect, in order to ensure the requisite synergy and coherence to better serve the Organization and the world."
