Despite what the famous painting might want to tell you, dogs would be terrible poker players. We pick up their cues all too easily. Cats also have sophisticated body language \u2013 their moods are signalled through twitching tails, ruffled fur, and the position of ears and whiskers. A purr usually (but not always) signals friendliness or contentment. They\u2019re a usually reliable method of working out if the cat is in friendly mode or best left alone. While we can reasonably be sure of a dog\u2019s bond with us, despite the thousands of years domesticated cats have kept us company, they still suffer something of a bad PR image. The independence that many see as a bonus is seen by others as aloofness or selfishness. Their detractors claim they only really show affection when a food bowl is empty. Cat owners will claim this is all nonsense, of course, and that their bond with their cat is as strong as any dog owner\u2019s. But why does this image of the aloof, unfriendly cat remain? And is there any truth to it? Take the way cats rub themselves against their owners. This used to be thought of as a kind of territory marker, like wild cats might do on trees or other landmarks in their territory. But when they do it on people, it\u2019s usually a sign of affiliation \u2013 the cat is transferring its scent onto your skin, and at the same time transferring yours onto its fur. This is what feral cats do with other cats they are allied with. It is a way of creating a \u201ccommon scent\u201d which distinguishes friend from foe. Ultimately, Hiestand says, one thing is key \u2013 relaxed cats are more likely to want to make friends. \u201cThey want their water and their food and their sleeping arrangements and their litter tray just right, and when they are right, they\u2019re able to start exploring those social bonds.\u201d So, the next time you come home to find a cat quietly surveying you from the couch, or lazily yawning as they pad their way into the hallway, don\u2019t be disappointed. In their own, quiet way, they\u2019re letting you know it\u2019s good to see you."
