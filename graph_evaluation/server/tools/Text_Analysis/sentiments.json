This sentiment along with the score obtained is returned in response as JSON object. If twitter url is supplied then the corresponding tweet is also returned in response. The main value which reflect sentiment of a text is score which could be below zero - mostly negative sentiment or above zero - mostly positive. We convert continuous score to two major classes with negative sentiment considered for (score<=-0.58), neutral assumed at (-0.25<score<0.25), and positive considered for (score >=0.25). Such division is subjective and could be used as it is for text classification by sentiments.",
