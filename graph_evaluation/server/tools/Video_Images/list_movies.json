There, he meets and begins a casual friendship with Gretta Adler, their friendship based on a shared love and goal of a profession in the creative arts. But also on this trip, Richard stumbles across the Mercury Theatre and meets Orson Welles, who, based on an impromptu audition, offers Richard an acting job as Lucius in his modern retelling of Julius Caesar, which includes such stalwart Mercury Theatre players as Joseph Cotten and George Coulouris. Despite others with official roles as producer John Houseman, this production belongs to Welles, the unofficial/official dictator. In other words, whatever Welles wants, the cast and crew better deliver. These requests include everything, even those of a sexual nature. Welles does not believe in conventions and will do whatever he wants, which includes not having a fixed opening date, although the unofficial opening date is in one week's time. In turn, Welles realizes that his name will either be strengthened or ruined in the theater community by this production. Richard is taken under the wing by the production's Jane-of-All-Trades, Sonja Jones. Known as the Ice Queen by the male cast, Sonja deflects much of the unwanted sexual attention by jokingly implying that she and Richard are having a fling, which Richard wants nothing more than to be the truth. As the end of the week and opening night approaches, Richard, having seen Welles' behavior, has to decide if acting in this production is worth it at any cost.\u2014Huggo",

The Regent, a Prince originally from Hungary, and the most-recent, now-deceased Queen married for convenience. As such, the Regent has spent time with a series of lady friends while on his travels in his somewhat \"free\" state.

When seemingly-simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation instead has his eyes set on one of the minor players in the show, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation from the Regent for that evening, she clearly understands the implications when she learns upon her arrival at the Carpathian Embassy, where the Regent and the Carpathian entourage are staying, that the party is just for two. On the Regent's relatively short stay in London, he just wants to have some fun; Elsie doesn't mind fun within a proper context: no dinners for two without a formal getting-to-know-each-other period. Elsie gets caught up in the diplomatic and geopolitical side of the issues when she inadvertently meets the other two royal members of the Carpathian entourage: the Queen Dowager, the Regent's mother-in-law, who isn't as hard-of-hearing as she suggests as she carries out her duties; and Nicholas VIII, the Regent's son and 16-year-old current King, who will take over official duties when he comes of age in 18 months--and who, unlike his father, is sympathetic to both the democratic process in wanting free elections in Carpathia and to the Germans he's related to on his mother's side.

There, he meets and begins a casual friendship with Gretta Adler, their friendship based on a shared love and goal of a profession in the creative arts. But also on this trip, Richard stumbles across the Mercury Theatre and meets Orson Welles, who, based on an impromptu audition, offers Richard an acting job as Lucius in his modern retelling of Julius Caesar, which includes such stalwart Mercury Theatre players as Joseph Cotten and George Coulouris. Despite others with official roles as producer John Houseman, this production belongs to Welles, the unofficial/official dictator. In other words, whatever Welles wants, the cast and crew better deliver. These requests include everything, even those of a sexual nature. Welles does not believe in conventions and will do whatever he wants, which includes not having a fixed opening date, although the unofficial opening date is in one week's time. In turn, Welles realizes that his name will either be strengthened or ruined in the theater community by this production. Richard is taken under the wing by the production's Jane-of-All-Trades, Sonja Jones. Known as the Ice Queen by the male cast, Sonja deflects much of the unwanted sexual attention by jokingly implying that she and Richard are having a fling, which Richard wants nothing more than to be the truth. As the end of the week and opening night approaches, Richard, having seen Welles' behavior, has to decide if acting in this production is worth it at any cost.\u2014Huggo",

The Regent, a Prince originally from Hungary, and the most-recent, now-deceased Queen married for convenience. As such, the Regent has spent time with a series of lady friends while on his travels in his somewhat \"free\" state. In meeting one of those London women, music-hall actress Maisie Springfield, and the company of her current production \"The Coconut Girl,\" the Regent has his eye on one of the show's minor players, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly-simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation instead has his eyes set on one of the minor players in the show, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation from the Regent for that evening, she clearly understands the implications when she learns upon her arrival at the Carpathian Embassy, where the Regent and the Carpathian entourage are staying, that the party is just for two. On the Regent's relatively short stay in London, he just wants to have some fun; Elsie doesn't mind fun within a proper context: no dinners for two without a formal getting-to-know-each-other period. Elsie gets caught up in the diplomatic and geopolitical side of the issues when she inadvertently meets the other two royal members of the Carpathian entourage: the Queen Dowager, the Regent's mother-in-law, who isn't as hard-of-hearing as she suggests as she carries out her duties; and Nicholas VIII, the Regent's son and 16-year-old current King, who will take over official duties when he comes of age in 18 months--and who, unlike his father, is sympathetic to both the democratic process in wanting free elections in Carpathia and to the Germans he's related to on his mother's side.

The London foreign office places great importance on Carpathia because of an unstable geopolitical situation with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany set to overthrow its monarchy government if allowed. The Regent, a Prince originally from Hungary, and the most-recent, now-deceased Queen married for convenience. As such, the Regent has spent time with a series of lady friends while on his travels in his somewhat \"free\" state. In meeting one of those London women, music-hall actress Maisie Springfield, and the company of her current production \"The Coconut Girl,\" the Regent has his eye on one of the show's minor players, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly-simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation instead has his eyes set on one of the minor players in the show, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation from the Regent for that evening, she clearly understands the implications when she learns upon her arrival at the Carpathian Embassy, where the Regent and the Carpathian entourage are staying, that the party is just for two. On the Regent's relatively short stay in London, he just wants to have some fun; Elsie doesn't mind fun within a proper context: no dinners for two without a formal getting-to-know-each-other period. Elsie gets caught up in the diplomatic and geopolitical side of the issues when she inadvertently meets the other two royal members of the Carpathian entourage: the Queen Dowager, the Regent's mother-in-law, who isn't as hard-of-hearing as she suggests as she carries out her duties; and Nicholas VIII, the Regent's son and 16-year-old current King, who will take over official duties when he comes of age in 18 months--and who, unlike his father, is sympathetic to both the democratic process in wanting free elections in Carpathia and to the Germans he's related to on his mother's side. All these goings-on make for a difficult few days for Northbrook, the foreign office's envoy who has just temporarily taken over this file.\u2014Huggo",
