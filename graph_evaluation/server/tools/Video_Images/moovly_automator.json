            "description": "A Job is our Unit-of-work for generating videos based on templates by replacing template variables by your values. A Job can be used to create a single video or multiple videos at once according to your use case. For each rendered video a credit will be deducted from your balance.\n\nThe rendering process takes several minutes, so we process this asynchronously. Therefore you must specify at least 1 notification type so we can send you the resulting video when it's ready. Ideally you provide a callback url back to your server to keep full control. You can also use one of our publishing notifications like YouTube, Google Drive, ... to automatically publish the video there if you have connected your account to the respective service first.\n\nYou can also generate a project instead of a render if you wish to preview the result first before rendering.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for a step by step explanation and all available features, like Text-to-Speech.",
