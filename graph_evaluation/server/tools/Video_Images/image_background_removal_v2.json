    "tool_description": "Automatic background/foreground removal service. Without resizing.  Cheaper and better than remove.bg. Free testing/developer API keys.\n\n\nThere is nothing worse than having a background image ruin your website/app. \nWe remove backgrounds using deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). Our network learns to recognize the difference between the foreground (your content, text, etc.) and the background (the rest of the picture), allowing our software to automatically separate the two.  We use modern artificial intelligence technology to solve this problem for you. Our cloud-based platform can process images at scale",
