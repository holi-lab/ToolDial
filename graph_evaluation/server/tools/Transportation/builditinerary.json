            "description": "A POST method that builds the itinerary.\n\n**Input**:\n- the start and end time of the route as timestamp objects\n- the places ids\n- the visiting nodes' information:\n          -type of place: Available options: \"Start\" and \"End\" for starting/ending nodes and \"Visit\" for all other nodes\n         -the available time windows of the locations\n         -the duration of stay for every location\n         -the penalty involved to drop a location in case of a non-feasible solution. The higher the penalty, the higher the severity of omission of the location and so the model will prefer not to drop a location with higher penalty\n -the time matrix: a square matrix containing time to get to and/from any destination (in seconds). So for instance, in the example input given there are in total 8 nodes (4 representing the start/end points for the 2 days and 4 representing the visits), so the matrix dimensions should be (8,8).\n\nFor every day a start and end point should be given as separate nodes, so for a 2-day route, 4 nodes additional to the visit nodes should be provided.",
