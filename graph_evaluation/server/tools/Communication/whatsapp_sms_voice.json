The format should be as follows 212xxxxxxxxx\n\n\"owner\": The owner field identifies the owner or sender of the notification. This is the email you used to sign up for the product on jaarvis.io\n\n\"deviceId\": This is the ID of your device on the Jaarvis platform\n\n\"mediaPath\": The mediaPath field is used to specify the path or URL of any media content that you want to include in the notification. It could be a picture or an mp4 video that does notexceed 4mb.\n\nTo use this JSON object as a payload for a POST request API, you would typically pass it as the request body in your HTTP POST request. The API endpoint should be set to the appropriate URL for the notification service, and you should ensure that you provide valid values for the \"content\", \"contact\", and \"owner\" fields, as these are likely required fields for the notification to be successfully sent. If the \"deviceId\" and \"mediaPath\" fields are optional for the API, you can include them in the request payload as needed.",
