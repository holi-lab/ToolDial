    "tool_description": "The Spam Scanner API provides a way to scan individual messages or text for Spammy content. This API is primarily designed for email but can be used for any kind of spam, including message spam, comment spam, etc. The data provided is checked against an extensive spam database, and if there's spammy content such as a spammy URL or domain, spammy text or a spammy email address, Spam Scanner will classify the message as spam. This is an early version of the API, so while it is very limited right now, there will be more coming if there is enough interest.",
