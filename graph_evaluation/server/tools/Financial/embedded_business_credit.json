For the function to work successfully, all required fields must be present when the endpoint is called. This call will initiate Fundation's automated credit strategy and will return an instant decision. Calling this endpoint is ideal in situations where you have all the required fields on-hand or are willing to capture the supplemental data points we need, over and above what you customarily have available on your customer. If that isn't possible we suggest using our Prefill App endpoint.",
