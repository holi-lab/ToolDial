Moreover, a tighter labor market and pent-up demand will likely keep household spending growing briskly. That said, uncertainty surrounding the ongoing health crisis, geopolitical tensions and volatile oil prices pose downside risks to the outlook. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP growing 5.7% in 2022, which is up 0.1 percentage points from the last month’s forecast. In 2023, the panel sees economic growth at 3.2%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"GDP growth should have remained healthy in Q4, but likely slowed from the third quarter’s strong reading due to a less favorable base effect. The non-oil private sector PMI matched the previous quarter’s level on average in Q4, pointing to upbeat activity despite some Omicron-related disruptions weighing on production. Meanwhile, annual oil production growth accelerated in the fourth quarter in line with OPEC+’s decision to ease output cuts, which should have kept overall GDP growing at a brisk pace. Turning to Q1 this year, economic growth is seen gaining momentum as oil production continues to pick up. That being said, non-oil sector growth is likely moderating, as suggested by the non-oil private sector PMI hitting the lowest level since October 2020 in January, with some lingering disruptions caused by the Omicron variant weighing on both foreign and domestic demand conditions.",

Private consumption growth accelerated in the period, while fixed investment rebounded robustly. Meanwhile, exports surged in the quarter, and consequently the external sector had a neutral impact on the overall headline reading, which contrasted the strong subtraction from growth recorded in Q3. Turning to this year, economic growth is likely moderating as the latest wave of Covid-19 cases and elevated inflationary pressures drag on economic sentiment. Consumer confidence dipped for the first time since September in January, while the IHS manufacturing PMI hit the lowest level since November 2020 in the same month. Nevertheless, the economy should continue to grow at a robust pace in the first quarter, aided by upbeat investment levels and government spending.",

Turning to Q1 2022, activity is likely still fairly muted due to the spread of the Omicron variant domestically, ongoing property-market weakness and a push to ensure clear skies for the February Winter Olympics, which could dent industrial output. As a result, the authorities have eased policy in recent weeks, which should provide some support: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has cut a host of interest rates, while the central government has taken steps to boost infrastructure spending.",

The resurgent pandemic and the potential for more stringent restrictions remain key downside risks to the outlook. FocusEconomics panelists see the economy expanding 2.8% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast, and 1.5% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"Activity in the fourth quarter is likely to have improved after Q3’s sharp contraction. An advancing vaccination campaign and a steep reduction in daily Covid-19 cases allowed for the easing of restrictions at the outset of Q4, with consumer sentiment clocking its highest level since before the pandemic in October–December. Moreover, the composite PMI averaged higher in Q4 than in the prior quarter, recording a multi-year high in November. However, the start of 2022 appears less positive, with the outbreak of the Omicron variant pushing daily cases to record levels in January. As a consequence, authorities have imposed quasi-state of emergency measures in a number of key prefectures including Tokyo, leading the PMI to fall into contractionary territory in January amid falling domestic demand. Meanwhile, the government put forward its draft budget to be debated by the lower house in February, with a record JPY 108 trillion (USD 940 billion) in spending plans.",

Consumer sentiment fell back into pessimistic territory in December as the new Covid-19 variant dealt a heavy blow to both economic and income expectations. Furthermore, business sentiment dropped to a 10-month low in December, with supply bottlenecks adding to concerns. Moreover, even before the arrival of Omicron, industrial output contracted in November over the prior month, highlighting fragility in the goods-producing sector in the quarter. However, the economy should recover promptly. Business sentiment beat expectations in January, while the composite PMI rose to a four-month high in the same month due to surging manufacturing activity and a recovery in services. This bodes well for the first quarter of the year.",

That said, PMI data suggests that momentum was dampened at the end of the quarter by high inflation and surging Covid-19 cases. Heading to Q1, the economy appeared to have a soft start—as indicated by January PMI data. However, restrictions on domestic activity and international travel were recently loosened, boding well for activity ahead.

That said, healthy household spending should keep the economy growing at a brisk pace. Uncertainty over the emergence of the Omicron variant, supply chain difficulties and twin deficits pose risks. FocusEconomics panelists project GDP to expand 8.0% in FY 2022, which is up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month’s forecast. In FY 2023, our panel expects growth of 6.4%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"After economic growth moderated in Q3 (FY Q2 2021), mainly due to a fading base effect, activity should have eased further year-on-year in Q4, but will have likely strengthened in sequential terms. In October–December, the composite goods PMI averaged notably higher than in the previous quarter, while the PHDCCI economy GPS index—a leading indicator of GDP—hit a fresh record high in December, pointing to healthier demand dynamics relative to Q3. Shifting focus to this calendar year, new Covid-19 cases have surged in recent weeks, leading authorities to tighten some restrictions to contain the spread, but this should have a relatively limited impact on the economic recovery. Meanwhile, the government is expected to unveil its fiscal year 2022–2023 Union Budget on 1 February, which should see slightly stronger spending more than offset by higher revenues, leading to a narrowing of the fiscal deficit.",

The uncertain trajectory of the pandemic and election-related uncertainty ahead of the 2022 presidential elections cloud the outlook. Our analysts see the economy expanding 3.8% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 2.2% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"GDP growth slowed markedly in sequential terms in Q4, largely due to more moderate domestic activity. Growth in both household and government spending cooled notably, while fixed investment expanded at a quicker pace. Turning to this year, early indicators suggest that the economy is continuing to expand in Q1, albeit at a slower rate, likely weighed on by record-high numbers of Covid-19 cases. Activity in the services sector cooled to a nine-month low in January, largely due to staff shortages, while subdued client demand amid the spread of the Omicron variant weighed on both the services and the manufacturing sectors. More positively, however, business sentiment improved to a near four-year high in the same month, boding well for private sector activity. On top of this, gradually easing Covid-19 curbs from early February should provide an additional boost to activity.",

Moreover, a fragile fiscal position, a heavy debt burden and political polarization in the run-up to October’s elections could all weigh on activity. Ongoing pandemic-related uncertainty remains a key risk to the outlook. FocusEconomics analysts see the economy expanding 0.9% in 2022, which is down 0.3 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 1.8% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"After the economy fell into recession in Q3, conditions will have likely remained muted in the final quarter of 2021. Economic activity contracted in October amid shrinking industrial output and weak retail sales. Moreover, consumer sentiment remained deeply pessimistic in Q4, while the manufacturing PMI ended the year at its lowest level since May 2020. Elevated inflation throughout the quarter—amid supply disruptions, spiking food prices and ever-high energy costs as the worst drought in nearly a century hinders hydroelectric capacity—has precipitated a sharp tightening of interest rates, likely further impacting domestic demand. Regarding the pandemic, while Covid-19 cases have spiked in early 2022 due to the arrival of the Omicron variant, the domestic vaccination campaign has accelerated markedly in recent months, which should reduce the health and economic impact of the latest outbreak.",

Nevertheless, a lower unemployment rate, elevated household savings and further progress on the vaccination front should support private spending. Uncertainty surrounding new variants of the virus, potential stop-start restrictions and volatile oil prices cast a shadow over the outlook. FocusEconomics analysts project growth of 4.0% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month. In 2023, our analysts see growth easing to 3.0%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"GDP growth should have strengthened slightly in Q4 after rebounding robustly in Q3. Monthly GDP in October expanded at the quickest pace since June, while a preliminary estimate for November pointed to another solid increase in output, albeit slowing from October. Moreover, retail sales growth averaged higher in October–November compared to Q3, while the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level since February 2020, pointing to healthy domestic demand conditions in the period. Furthermore, the manufacturing PMI averaged slightly higher in Q4 relative to the previous quarter, boding well for GDP. Turning to Q1, growth should moderate as the spread of the Omicron variant has led to a tightening of lockdown restrictions in parts of the country. That said, restrictions are set to ease in February, and an improving labor market and solid wage growth should continue to support the economy.",

                        "economicOutlook":"The economy rebounded in sequential terms in Q3 last year, supported by the easing of restrictions, but annual growth eased on a fading base effect. Underlying momentum should have softened in Q4. Activity dropped month-on-month in October, while stubbornly high inflation in October–December and declining consumer sentiment in the quarter likely restrained consumer spending. Meanwhile, clouds are gathering over the economy in the first stretch of the new year: Covid-19 cases have soared to record numbers amid the spread of the Omicron variant, while the government authorized an increase in prices for electricity and natural gas in a bid to reduce the fiscal deficit. Meanwhile, the sovereign bond market is seeing some turbulence as the country struggles to reach an agreement with the IMF for the repayment of its USD 45 billion debt, due to differences over the path to reducing the deficit.",

GDP likely rebounded in the fourth quarter, thanks to the easing of containment measures. Despite softer consumer confidence in the quarter and a jump in the unemployment rate in October, a strong labor market in November-December, coupled with surging retail sales in October and November, hints at robust private consumption. Moreover, business sentiment strengthened considerably in the quarter, suggesting upbeat private sector activity. Meanwhile, the housing market boom seemed to be fading at the end of 2021. Moving into this year, soaring Covid-19 cases amid the spread of the Omicron variant recently prompted authorities to tighten restrictions in New South Wales, casting a shadow on the economy at the outset of 2022.",

Nevertheless, a new surge in Covid-19 infections threatens to derail economic momentum at the outset of the year.

Although full details are yet to be released, a complicated domestic situation hints at a downbeat picture for activity in Q4: A spike in price pressures in October–December and gradually deteriorating consumer sentiment in the quarter will have likely weighed on private spending. Moreover, a wave of Covid-19 infections kept business confidence subdued in the same period, likely capping capital spending. Turning to this quarter, after the fourth wave seemingly subsided in late December, skyrocketing daily Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant have since swept the country and prompted authorities to announce new pandemic-related curbs. That said, protests against the measures quickly erupted, stopping authorities from implementing them despite rising hospitalizations.",

In 2023, the panel sees the economy expanding 3.7%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"Following Q3’s softer but robust expansion, available indicators suggest that positive dynamics carried on in the final quarter of last year. Industrial output grew at a quicker annual pace in October–November. This, coupled with double-digit growth in merchandise exports in the same period and a robust manufacturing PMI in the quarter, bodes well for private sector activity. Moreover, a low unemployment rate by historical standards in October–November will have supported household spending, although a markedly higher inflation rate in the quarter will have capped any gains. Less positively, surging numbers of Covid-19 cases since late December will weigh on activity at the outset of the new year. In other news, on 14 January, Fitch Ratings affirmed the country’s rating at ‘BB’ but upgraded its outlook from stable to positive, citing quicker-than-expected growth and a declining fiscal deficit.",

Accelerating household spending—helped by the lifting of restrictions and accumulated savings amid supportive fiscal and monetary policies—should fuel domestic demand, while foreign demand is poised to moderate, leading to a wider current account deficit. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists expect GDP to expand 5.2% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast. GDP is seen growing 5.3% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"Economic activity growth is expected to have strengthened in Q4 of last year, after cooling markedly in Q3 due to harsh lockdown measures. Retail sales increased notably in October-November and consumer confidence improved sharply in the quarter amid easing restrictions, boding well for household spending. Moreover, strong PMI readings hint at sustained expansions in the manufacturing sector during the quarter. Moving into 2022, the country has reported increasing numbers of new Covid-19 infections due to the spread of the Omicron variant, although the health situation looks better than in Q3 2021. Meanwhile, in mid-January top officials announced that the government will introduce new tax breaks on car sales and property in a bid to support economic recovery, while authorities have placed a ban on coal exports for the month of January to prevent energy shortages.",

Consumer confidence and the services PMI averaged lower in the period, with both falling steeply in December, suggesting weaker private spending. That said, unemployment continued to fall in the same month, suggesting that a strong job market offered some support. Moreover, the manufacturing sector was likely more resilient, as suggested by the manufacturing PMI falling less steeply than the services PMI. Heading into 2022, prospects appear brighter.

Moreover, upbeat service sector activity, robust retail sales and healthy consumer confidence suggest buoyant private spending. In addition, export data reached record highs in both Q4 and in 2021 as a whole. That said, downbeat business confidence points to weak investment and unemployment rose markedly in December. Meanwhile, tighter restrictions put in place in December should have weighed on momentum. Looking at Q1 2022, the latest data shows that exports remained buoyant in the first 20 days of January. However, authorities recently extended restrictions around the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday on 1 February, which will likely dent activity somewhat.",

Moreover, chip shortages could continue to dampen car production through at least the early part of the year. In addition, investment will likely be kept subdued by an uncertain business environment, amid the president’s proposed energy reform and attempted removal of some political checks and balances. FocusEconomics panelists project the economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast. In 2023, they see GDP growth waning to 2.4%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"After shrinking in Q3 on surging Covid-19 cases and the impact of the law restricting labor outsourcing, economic activity declined slightly further in October. However, momentum should still have recovered in Q4 as a whole. Both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs averaged higher compared to the prior quarter, while vehicle production was also up—albeit remaining subdued compared to pre-pandemic levels amid supply difficulties. Moreover, a falling unemployment rate through November and higher consumer confidence on average in Q4 bode well for private consumption. In other news, Covid-19 cases are surging at the outset of the new year due to Omicron. While this could dampen activity and sentiment somewhat, the economic impact should be muffled by the government’s relaxed handling of the pandemic.",

On 25 January, the new coalition announced that Covid-19 restrictions will be eased, allowing non-essential shops and services to reopen. This bodes well for economic activity ahead. Meanwhile, the economy likely cooled in Q4 last year amid tough restrictions due to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Household spending contracted month-on-month in November, despite a tighter labor market on average in the quarter. Moreover, the arrival of the new Covid-19 mutation caused consumer sentiment to deteriorate markedly in the fourth quarter. More positively, business confidence remained optimistic and the manufacturing PMI continued to signal robust activity on average in Q4.",

Moreover, private-sector credit grew at a markedly quicker pace in October–November, suggesting strengthening business activity. Furthermore, inflation cooled in the quarter overall, which should have supported household spending. In other news, hundreds of people were killed in a wave of attacks by armed bandits in the north-west of the country in early January, highlighting ongoing security problems. Meanwhile, the Electoral Act is likely to be amended ahead of the 2023 general elections to allow for electronic voting and result transmission, which should reduce voting fraud and suggests a smooth transition of power should the ruling APC party lose.",

Stronger growth in private spending will be sustained by a tighter labor market, and brisker export growth will further support activity. Ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic and the evolution of housing prices continues to cloud the outlook. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists estimate total GDP to grow 3.6% in 2022, which is up 0.2 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and to expand 2.1% in 2023. Our panel sees mainland GDP increasing 3.8% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from the prior month’s projection, and growing 2.0% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"Momentum will have cooled in Q4, with GDP contracting in monthly terms in October and November. November’s softer decline was largely due to improving domestic demand, as private and capital spending growth accelerated from October. Meanwhile, the external sector dragged down the overall reading, as exports declined and imports grew. Furthermore, the manufacturing PMI averaged lower in Q4 than in Q3, and business confidence ticked down in the period, although it remained robust. More positively, the unemployment rate dropped to a 21-month low in November. This, coupled with more upbeat consumer sentiment, should have sustained spending in Q4, although mounting price pressures will have capped the overall improvement. In mid-January, the measures reinstated in December to curb the spread of Omicron were eased partially, which should further support consumer spending.",

That said, a normalization of global trade should see export growth slow, while uncertainty surrounding the pandemic—with the potential for tighter restrictions—as well as the fragility of the country’s coalition government, clouds the outlook. FocusEconomics analysts see the economy growing 4.8% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s estimate, and 4.1% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"An early estimate put GDP growth for 2021 at a 14-year high, rebounding sharply from 2020’s contraction. Looking at available data for Q4, industrial production averaged notably higher than in Q3, while retail sales growth gained steam, indicating an improvement in consumer spending. Turning to Q1 2022, consumer and producer prices continued to rise in December, weighing on the manufacturing PMI in January. As a result, the government announced a second round of anti-inflation measures—containing deeper and extended VAT cuts on food items and energy—designed to reduce near-term price pressures. Meanwhile, President Duda put forward a bill to scrap a disciplinary chamber that has been a key flashpoint in a five-year dispute with the European Commission, paving the way for better relations between Warsaw and Brussels.",

Industrial output growth averaged slightly lower in October\u001f–November relative to Q3, while tourism revenues also ebbed in the same period. That said, retail sales accelerated markedly in October–November in annual terms and the Bank of Portugal’s daily economic activity indicator was above Q3 levels throughout Q4. Turning to Q1 2022, tighter Covid-19 restrictions, which were in place for the first ten days of the year amid record-high daily cases, bode ill for activity. In politics, national elections took place on 30 January, resulting in a majority for incumbent António Costa’s Socialist Party. The result ensures stability and should allow the passing of the budget that the party introduced in October 2021.",

Notably, the outlook is very volatile, with risks tilted increasingly towards the downside due to fears of a potential military conflict with Ukraine, which would likely prompt widespread Western sanctions, thus hurting Russia’s financial and energy sectors. FocusEconomics panelists project GDP to grow 2.6% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast, and 2.1% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"The economy seems to have finished last year on strong footing, exhibiting resilience to the fallout of the Omicron wave. Economic activity accelerated in October–November, largely on sturdier industrial production growth, which more than offset a slowdown in the services sector amid cooling retail sales. Moreover, both industrial output and PMI data suggest overall activity remained buoyant in December. Turning to the first quarter of this year, a relatively healthy economic backdrop—the composite PMI rose in January—has been increasingly overshadowed by escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, spelling trouble for the country’s business environment. Western countries are reportedly finalizing sanctions that could include economic countermeasures against Russian banks, the country’s sovereign debt and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, among others, in response to a potential attack on Ukraine.",

Moreover, a tighter labor market and pent-up demand will likely keep household spending growing briskly. That said, uncertainty surrounding the ongoing health crisis, geopolitical tensions and volatile oil prices pose downside risks to the outlook. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP growing 5.7% in 2022, which is up 0.1 percentage points from the last month’s forecast. In 2023, the panel sees economic growth at 3.2%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"GDP growth should have remained healthy in Q4, but likely slowed from the third quarter’s strong reading due to a less favorable base effect. The non-oil private sector PMI matched the previous quarter’s level on average in Q4, pointing to upbeat activity despite some Omicron-related disruptions weighing on production. Meanwhile, annual oil production growth accelerated in the fourth quarter in line with OPEC+’s decision to ease output cuts, which should have kept overall GDP growing at a brisk pace. Turning to Q1 this year, economic growth is seen gaining momentum as oil production continues to pick up. That being said, non-oil sector growth is likely moderating, as suggested by the non-oil private sector PMI hitting the lowest level since October 2020 in January, with some lingering disruptions caused by the Omicron variant weighing on both foreign and domestic demand conditions.",

However, tax hikes and tighter labor market rules will limit the scope of the recovery somewhat, while weak fiscal metrics, high inflation, protracted supply constraints and a slow absorption of EU funds pose downside risks. Our panelists downgraded the outlook again this month and now project the economy to grow 5.5% in 2022, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 3.6% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"The pace of economic expansion softened in quarter-on-quarter terms in Q4. A downturn in consumer spending amid the spread of the Omicron variant and surging inflation—despite a decline in the unemployment rate—was chiefly responsible for the slowdown. On the flip side, the expansion in fixed investment accelerated, hitting an over one-year high. Meanwhile, latest data shows that productivity in Q3 was well below pre-crisis levels, while public debt followed its upward trend in November. Additionally, the government recently proposed a hike to social contributions for self-employed workers, while it also reached a deal to tighten labor market rules—both of which could weigh on job creation ahead. On top of that, in January the country’s independent fiscal authority warned the government against the absence of a detailed budgetary plan on the use of EU funds.",

Pandemic-related uncertainty amid the potential for new variants, and protracted supply chain disruptions remain key risks to the outlook. FocusEconomics panelists see GDP expanding 3.3% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month’s forecast, and 2.1% in 2023.",
                        "economicOutlook":"Economic activity slowed in Q4, according to a preliminary reading, with growth easing from Q3’s solid rise. The slowdown likely came on the back of weaker private consumption growth, with consumer sentiment turning pessimistic in November–December, and steadily rising inflation likely weighing on household spending in the quarter. Nevertheless, underlying momentum was seemingly robust, as evidenced by PMI readings for both the manufacturing and services sectors remaining well within expansionary territory throughout the quarter, and the economic tendency indicator staying close to a record-high level in December. Meanwhile, in late January authorities extended domestic Covid-19-related measures that were tightened in December amid rising daily cases. The majority are set to be lifted on 9 February, however.",

However, momentum should remain strong nonetheless, supported by a healthy labor market spurring private consumption. Covid-19 variants, and the gradual weakening of trade links with the EU in the absence of a revamped trade deal, cloud the outlook. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists project the economy to expand 3.0% in 2022, which is unchanged from the previous month’s forecast. In 2023, the panel expects GDP to grow 1.9%.",
                        "economicOutlook":"After slowing slightly in Q3, economic growth likely lost some further steam in Q4 amid a rise in Covid-19 cases and a consequent slight tightening of restrictions. That said, underlying momentum still seemed fairly robust, with both the manufacturing and services PMIs averaging well in expansionary territory in the quarter, and the KOF Economic Barometer notably above its long-term average through December. Moreover, the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level since Q4 2019 in Q4, which should have boosted domestic demand. Turning to this year, the government has so far avoided new domestic restrictions despite surging Covid-19 cases, which is supporting activity—as suggested by January’s KOF Barometer. Moreover, travel rules were recently relaxed, which should aid tourism.",

                        "economicOutlook":"After fairly mild growth in Q3, underlying momentum appeared to improve substantially in Q4, as suggested by a notable rise in the non-manufacturing PMI. In particular, the combination of tumbling unemployment, the vaccine rollout and the government’s stimulus voucher scheme seemed to spur private consumption, with retail sales surging in October and November. That said, the industrial sector appeared to lose some momentum amid supply difficulties, with the manufacturing PMI averaging lower than in Q3. Turning to the new year, the recent extension of the government’s “Invest in Taiwan” initiative, which provides support for firms who relocate production to the island, bodes well for capital spending: The initiative has reportedly attracted applications worth over USD 50 billion since it began in July 2019. However, an uptick in Covid-19 cases risks a snap-back of restrictions.",

However, red-hot inflation, an unstable currency and unorthodox policies pose key downside risks. FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast panelists project the economy to expand 3.4% in 2022, which is unchanged from last month, and 3.6% in 2023.",

Industrial output growth eased in October–November, amid softer output expansions in mining and quarrying, and manufacturing. Moreover, the manufacturing PMI moderated notably in the fourth quarter as a whole, while business confidence eased in the period. Furthermore, consumer sentiment deteriorated in December, plunging to an all-time low. Conditions remained challenging at the outset of the first quarter, with the manufacturing PMI retreating further as elevated price pressures suppressed demand and subsequently output growth. Moreover, very high inflation will dampen household spending in the quarter, despite a notable recovery in consumer sentiment and strong wage growth. President Erdogan recently ordered a 50% increase to the minimum wage, while private-sector salaries have also risen notably.",
