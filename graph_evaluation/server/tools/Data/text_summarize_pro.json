However, after experiencing years of defeats, it's easy to feel discouraged and give up rather than risk further setbacks and disappointments. Have you ever felt this way? To be honest, I don't have all the answers. I can't tell you what the right course of action is; only you will know. However, it's important not to be discouraged by failure when pursuing a goal or a dream, as failure itself can mean different things to different people.  For someone with a Fixed Mindset, failure can be a blow to their self-esteem. But for someone with a Growth Mindset, it's an opportunity to learn, improve, and find new ways to overcome obstacles. Same failure, yet different responses. Who is right and who is wrong? Neither. Each person has a different mindset that shapes their outcome. Those who are resilient stay in the game longer and draw on their inner resources to succeed.  I've coached many clients who gave up after years of hard work towards their goals or dreams. But it was often at that point that their biggest breakthrough came. Perhaps all those years of perseverance finally paid off. As the 19th Century's minister Henry Ward Beecher once said: \"One's best success comes after their greatest disappointments.\" None of us knows what the future holds, so our only guide is whether we can endure repeated defeats and disappointments and still pursue our dreams.  Consider the advice from the American academic and psychologist Angela Duckworth, who writes in her book \"Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance\": \"Many of us, it seems, quit what we start far too early and far too often. Even more than the effort a gritty person puts in on a single day, what matters is that they wake up the next day, and the next, ready to get on that treadmill and keep going.\"  One thing I know for certain is this: don't settle for less than what you're capable of. Strive for something bigger. Some of you reading this might identify with this message because it resonates with you on a deeper level. For others, who may feel at the end of their rope, the message might seem like just another pep talk. But regardless of where you are in your journey, my message is clear: NEVER settle for less. If you settle for less, you will receive less than you deserve and convince yourself that you are justified in receiving less.  \"Your problem is to bridge the gap which exists between where you are now and the goal you intend to reach.\"\u200a\u2014\u200aEarl Nightingale  I remember a passage my father often used when I was growing up in the 1990s: \"Don't tell me your problems unless you've spent weeks trying to solve them yourself.\" That advice has echoed in my mind for decades and has become my motivator. Don't rely on other people or outside circumstances to motivate you, because you will be let down every time. Motivation must come from within you. Keep working on your problems until you find a solution. Problems are not stop signs; they are guiding you to put in more effort to overcome them. Most of the time, problems help you gain new skills or develop the resources you need to succeed later on. So embrace your challenges and develop the grit to push past them instead of retreating in resignation.  Where are you settling in your life right now?"
