Sentiment Analysis also gives the user the possibility of detecting the polarity of user-defined entities and concepts, making the service a flexible tool applicable to any kind of scenario. Additionally, Sentiment Analysis detects if the text processed is subjective or objective and if it contains irony marks [beta], both at global and sentence level, giving the user additional information about the reliability of the polarity obtained from the sentiment analysis.",
