Opening the app normally wi bring you to the home page, but nothing is loaded, and you aren't able to do anything. You are able to view the side bar, but as soon as you let go of it, it'll instantly hide again. Using the shortcuts works, kind of, but the homepage is unusable in this state. Seriously don't recommend until any way of fixing the issue is released.",
                        "This app is frustrating as heck. When you're scrolling through your timeline, it will randomly shoot off to a whole different part of the timeline. When you search for past posts you made, half the time, they won't appear. When you \"leave\" a conversation, it won't even let you comment on that post again. And when you just want to send an email to Twitter's support team asking about these issues, there's no contact info. Just endless screens that circle back on each other.",
                        "As of today the app is completely non-functional on my device (Pixel 6 Pro). Have tried restarting my device, force closing the app several times, and uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothing works at all. Even in general though, it truly is astounding how much worse the Android version is compared to the iOS version, even on a major platform like the Pixel. It really isn't even close to as good of an experience.",
                        "Extremely primitive design. No ability to see a list of just the people you follow. Must manually search for them every time. No ability to sort whatsoever. One big convoluted mess. Slow and unresponsive. No Twitter is not better in the app. They need to take a look at the YouTube app. Did I just travel back in time 20 years?",
                        "Terrible update. When you click into a video, it cuts off ¬º of the bottom of the screen, so you miss a decent amount of what you are trying to see. When you try going to landscape, it just switches to a new video. There very clearly trying to be more like tiktok in how they function. They've also added a lot more ads than there were. You now see ads every few posts. With the trajectory they're taking now, the service will be unusable in a few months."
