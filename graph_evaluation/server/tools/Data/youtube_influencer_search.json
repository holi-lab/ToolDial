I'm on the quest of bridging the gap between straight and plus sizes for women who fall between straight and plus size categories, sizes 6-8-10-12! It's an unfamiliar and uncategorized place, so I'm bringing awareness to it and creating a space for those of us who don't see themselves represented in mainstream media and social media. I hope you gain inspiration, build confidence, and love yourself a little more after watching my content!\n\nFor reference:\nTops: M\nBottoms: 8/10\nBust: 34D\nWaist: 29\"\nHip: 44\"\nHeight: 5\u20197\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out my site for more http://MeridethMorgan.com\n\nThanks for being here!",

We traveled all over the country while I was growing up, moving across the country all most every 6 months.  I have lived in small towns and big cities including New York and LA but now find Arizona to be the place I call home.  My Journey started when I was about 18 being diagnosed with Endometriosis and Cervical cancer.  That was what I thought to be the worst day of my life, however, I was soon to find out, it wasn't close.  After 20+ years and cancer 3 more times, other diagnoses, and a million health problems later I have terminal cancer and severe health conditions and pills, I discovered an oncologist that recommended cannabis to me, so just like thousands of people I researched cannabis.  AND HERE WE ARE, ALIVE, TAKING 10 YES 10 LESS MEDICATIONS AND NO MORE PAIN MEDS!!!  I want to invite each and every one of you to join me on my adventure!",
