            "description": "Create a new Quora search URL data extraction job for either a posts search or question search.  Here you can extract as many records as required from any Quora search URL and either post the data back to your system via callback field or use the second result endpoint to fetch the results once the job is completed. Jobs are usually completed between 30 seconds for small result values such as 10 to 100 and 4 minutes for results over 1000 for example.\n\nIf you want to use the Job Results endpoint to retrieve your results please make sure you save the jobid value from this endpoint response which will be used to get your results.\n\nThe \"record\" value tells us the number of results you want returned. For example 1 Quora search result such as a post or question and all its related data fields is equivalent to 1 \"record\".\n\nType indicates whether you are searching Quora post or Quora questions. Value can either be \"post\" or \"question\".\n\nURL refers to the Quora search URL you want to gather data from. Please use the URL type that matches the search type.\n\nFor post type the URL value would look like this example: https://www.quora.com/search?q=cats&type=post&time=month\n\nFor question type the URL value would look like this example: https://www.quora.com/search?q=cats&type=question&time=month\nAny standard functional Quora search URL with any supported parameters can be submitted.\n\nCallback value should be a full webhook URL for posting the results directly to your system once the job is completed.",
