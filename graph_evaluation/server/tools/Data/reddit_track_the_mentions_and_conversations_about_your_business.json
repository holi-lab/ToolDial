Having camera just hanging on my shoulder with no protection isn't good because it kicks on the rocks when climbing.\n\nIn general, I like [neoprene cases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6SWDK5) because they provide some protection and weight almost nothing, but they get wet easily even during the light rain unless I apply waterproof spray.\n\nI find [leather cases](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084HSNPKQ) quite useful in general, but their weight makes overall kit weight almost 800g, and I can't find a good design one, which would cover the camera from rain, but also allow easy access to the ports and battery compartment.\n\nI never tried [neoprene bag inserts](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07S7LQRH6) but the design looks interesting, allosing taking camera out easily.\n\nDo you have any suggestions which bag/case type should work best for my needs?\n\nThank you in advance",

My recruiter has not responded yet this week.  I accepted my offer on June 14th which was contingent on background and drug screening, all of which is done which im clean on both. Communication is not great at the moment, bad look for Amazon recruitment. I do not wish to bother my manager.... Yet.  Im trying to have patience but I think its justified as for I would like to put my current employer on notice.  Any insights would be appreciated.",
