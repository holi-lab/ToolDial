This game is a little more or a grind than other Angry Birds games, which is completely fine. People don’t realize that Rovio needs to make money off of the game, and proceed to say it is bad for that reason. Don’t take their word, and know this is a game you won’t regret downloading. This game isn’t perfect, like all others, having small bugs like certain power ups not working (like the golden ducks), but other than that, there’s really nothing wrong with this game. And if any other people reading this are about to make a 1 star review that all of the Angry Birds games are gone, and it’s Rovio’s fault, don’t and just be patient. \n\n Also, I’m sorry if all of these thoughts are jumbled up, I tried to simplify things and I didn’t read it over because I’m lazy, so it might not make sense.",

First of all, the heart system is absolutely awful, this game gets hard in the later levels, so having to wait twenty minutes after failing a few times for just one more chance before waiting another twenty minutes is just atrocious. Also why is there clans in this game? Literally no reason to have clans in this type of game. It’s very clear they were just added because people like online features in games. My biggest gripe is with the way the levels go. You have your cards randomized at the start of each level, which is pretty annoying but I would let go if not for the fact that there are several different randomized layouts for the same section on the same level. It makes it so you can’t learn the ins and outs of a certain section, because it could be different every time, this combined with the randomized cards at the start can make some levels over before they even begin which is completely out of your control. I also hate how the birds feel a lot weaker compared to how they felt in the first one, blue birds in this game is complexity useless, and yellow birds aren’t much better. The only birds who are truly good are the bomb bird and the big red bird. The gameplay at its core is still fun like the original, but is plagued by all the issues this game has.",

Rovio recently re-released the first Angry Birds game under their new “classics” line for the original price of a dollar, and I had an insane amount of fun with that- it was easy to see why the game became a hit in the first place. Since all the other angry birds games have been pulled from the app store, I figured this one is next to try. What a complete 180!\n\nThis game is nothing but a monetized, ad-riddled mess. There are a few interesting twists, like picking the order you throw the birds and getting bonus birds for good scores, but everything else seems designed to strip away strategy and push micro transactions. I can’t even play two levels in a row without the game giving me an ad or trying to sell me some of the half dozen currencies that will make my birds stronger or let me buy hats or lord knows what else. \n\nI’m uninstalling after less than a couple hours. I don’t see what the fun in playing a game that so desperately wants to milk your for money can be. The original Angry Birds was an amazing venture into looking at what kinds of games can be designed for a mobile device to play easily in quick bursts. This game (and I struggle to even call it that) is nothing but a sad reflection on what could have been a decade later.",

Starting off this game is ‘freemium’ which means that ads play after almost every level and there’s optional rewards/other incentives for watching them, which wouldn’t be so bad if the original was nothing like that. Two, it promotes gambling with loot boxes and an actual casino mini game that is essentially all or nothing, something that was also absent from most of the previous games. Thirdly, they are almost certainly stealing your data. Four, the game size is absolutely ridiculous with how much space updates can take up. Five, the heart system where if you fail a level you lose on of six hearts and when you’re all out you can’t play unless you watch an ad or wait 30 minutes. Last, but certainly no least, the levels are randomized as the structures you are meant to destroy can be completely different even when you replay the exact same level. In other games in the series each and every level is unique, but in this one they were too lazy so they decided to just randomize it. I loved the original and several of the other games as well, and I spent hours playing them, but this is just sad. If you want a good game, then buy the original. It is leagues better than this money grab. It actually has care put into it. And maybe if you download that game instead Rovio and the dev team will start making good games again.",

Progression can be done without pay to play but would be faster if you’re willing to pay.\nI’d probably give it at least 4 stars if not five, if it weren’t for the glitches combined with poor customer support. Some of the glitches can actually be fun, like when a tower starts to fall before you fire, or more rarely when a bird manages to fly to the next level from the previous one. The more annoying glitches can be quite frustrating, such as birds firing before you release, scores not being recorded in competitions, and not getting rewards after watching a video. To a degree, so glitches are expected and what can make or break a game is the customers support, which is the biggest fault I’ve found in the game. I had a support ticket closed with a reply or reason, which is fairly rude. I had another support ticket in which the customer service rep replied telling me it’s a connection problem on my end and a lot of people are currently experiencing them. I tried to explain to the rep that I had connection with the server and supplied what I thought was decent evidence. He never replied, the glitch, specifically in the great eagle trading camp continued to happen. After a week of being ignored, I deleted the game. Hope this helps",

First of all, and this might be a common opinion, but there are SO many ads. Occasionally, they’ll take you straight to the App Store even if you don’t tap it, and that is so agitating. Another thing is randomizing the bird cards at the beginning of each level, and in some cases, the layout for each level changes too. Later on in the game the levels get harder and harder and it would be nice to have a set-in-stone way to beat each level rather than getting lucky some day. Rovio has made a shuffle deck feature to change this problem but even then you have to rely on luck. (This next one is gonna trigger me the most) Remember in angry birds 1 when you got to retry a level as many times as you needed? Well now you only get five tries and when you run out, you have to wait about 25 minutes to get one try and for all the retries, you have to wait an hour or 2. overall, angry birds 2 has more bad thing than good, but there are small good things that are just outweighed by the bad things. I’m not gonna discourage you from getting this game, you just might want to take this review as a warning. And Rovio, if you’re listening to this, please fix the retry system.",

The graphics are rich and flow smoothly between all transitions. The levels evolve and progress in difficulty but encourage you to think critically and creatively. Defeating level after level is rewarding and builds you up for the next level. The multiplayer modes involving clans and competitive mode pit you against worthy opponents. \nWord of caution however, as there are the downsides. The app has its own pop-up encouraging you to buy into their in-app purchases. At my peak time in playing this game on a daily basis the app will encourage their in-app purchases around once an hour. What’s more is the ever-so-bothersome littering of advertisements of other games. The game even has an auto-jump to the App Store to encourage you to download another game app. While this is expected of less polished games this is rather a surprise of an established brand to have to use such tactics. Lastly, the levels do get repetitive and the “boss” battles lose their luster and become some sort of a sore level after awhile. \nOverall, if you don’t mind the ads and are in it to really squash those pigs then this is the right game to play. Swing away at a 3 out of 5 game.",

For instance, when completing “hard” levels you get a chest with feathers, but it’s the same chest with 250 or 300 feathers at game level 6 as it is at level 600.  Yet when you get to level 600, you probably need 30,000 feathers to advance your birds.  So getting 300 is irrelevant.  This sort of imbalance seems like it would drive people away as they get higher.\n\nHowever, I realized that may be the point.  Not to drive people away, but to make them bored and frustrated.  What do bored and frustrated people do?  They try to find ways to alleviate their boredom.  And what alleviates boredom in this case?  Getting rewards.  And what’s a good way to be sure you get rewards?  Buying gems to pay for success.  So the fact they don’t keep the game advancing to keep people interested isn’t a bug, it’s a feature, to get them to pay.\n\nWith that said, the game is still fun and addictive, for quite a while. I played it for months during the pandemic, and rarely felt the need to pay for gems.  But recently I realized my boredom has been driving me to purchase more and more often.

It’s fun, a nice way to kill some time, and the animations and graphics are beautiful.  But if you’ve ever played Mario Kart and know the general angry feeling you get when no matter what you do (or how skilled you are), the game just cheats to get the result it wants? Yup, get used to that here.  For example, in battle arena you’ll be pitted against various other “people” (in reality it’s not so, just the computer). And perhaps you’ll be winning the round, when all of a sudden it gives your opponent 2-3 more birds to play than it gave you.  There is no way you can win, but don’t fret, you can always buy some coins to try again.  Another gripe: The levels change often, so if you’re stuck on one (and maybe want to try a different strategy to get through) the next time you play it changes. Not completely, and there seems to be only a few options for each level, but again, infuriating.  Get used to watching ads too, as you’ll be bombarded constantly.  I miss the old angry birds games, where you’d pay a few bucks and the game was just that. It’s too bad this company would rather milk their customers than entertain them.",

My only issues are that when you run out of birds for a level and depending on luck for such. So let’s say I’m playing a level, on the last room and I fling my last bird. Most of the time, I just barely succeed. Other times, it’s either the bird misses completely or it forced me to pay gems just so the scene can play out even though the bird’s shot was perfect. I’ve wasted at least 180+ gems just to spare a few seconds for the scene to play out and it gets really annoying and agitating because I’ll be doing so well, only to be crushed by disappointment and frustration. And power ups and extra cards cost so many gems, it’s almost impossible to save up. Especially with the tower of fortune; I haven’t even made it past the 20th floor because the pig keeps catching me off guard. I’ve been robbed so much to the point of where I actually have to pick cards at a random pattern and hope I don’t get looted because it feels like a 8/10 chance of losing the rewards.",

When a player invests money into a game, that player has a right to cry “foul” when the integrity of the game is questionable:( For those who are not familiar with this game, this may may seem confusing. However, one glaring example of this lack of integrity is in an intricate part of the game called “the arena”. Here, you are matched up with a (supposedly equal) opponent to earn stars. The problem is the game is obviously “rigged”. I play a pretty good game, but when an opponent with half the “flock power” beats you by sometimes ridiculously high scores, something is really, really wrong! In the natural flow of the game, you play one or two birds on each page. Doesn’t happen here! The opponents score goes up, but their birds are still in line. What happens is on the last page all the birds appear to play and rack up mathematically impossible scores!!! No way to monitor what’s really happening:( If the creators of this game would clean up this dirty rigging of scores, I’d give it a five star. One other thing, this game requires a lot of time to play. If you want a quick game to pass time, this isn’t for you.",

I like to choose the freeze and duck spells to use together because ducks can break ice a little easier.

My other complaint is that this game offers us packages of spells, gems and pearls for REAL MONEY!!! Seriously?!  No one can earn redeemable coins for these perks?  Heck, at the very least there should be a reward system for completing a chapter and it should be something really great. Not like 5 gems, 3 feathers or 10 pearls. Save your real cash money.  I'm past level 180 and I got there without spending any additional money.  This is like a gambling game.  Don't fall for it. Oh, yeah! And Tower of Fortune?

Typically our bootcamp and battles are long and epic, you could complete 15 rooms which was a challenge, but possible. Now it’s much to difficult, because we don’t get our cards back per destruction, only 1 allowed back per bird... so too much destruction by one bird and you are punished. Did I mention we don’t get any spells back anymore? We can only use them in the daily challenge and the map, which are just stupid places to use spells..  They make events and and hat adventures now that can’t be completed EVEN with spending gems to move forward. It was already a money grab, but this is much too blatant now.

This was by far the most disappointing feature EVER! Instead of relaxing and playing some angry birds for who knows how long, once you lose your 5 lives you have to wait around 20 minutes just to get one more life. YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO PLAY! How dumb does that sound? That’s what turned me down from candy crush, as I thought it was just stupid to wait in order to play. The game itself has so many extra pay to win features that really just turn me off from what the original game used to be. Ads, gems and other exclusives you have to pay for have changed the once beloved angry birds into a pay to win, money grabbing disappointment I’ve ever seen. Literally the only improvement from the original angry birds is the better graphics, and that’s ABSOLUTELY IT. 1/100 of a game, do not get unless you just love to wait to play...

For some positives, the game is bright and colorful, and thats about it. During the game play you are given a random hand of 3 birds and you cant even pick your birds anymore to strategize. Also, you cant come up with a strategy to win a level because the levels are always being shuffled with new obstacles so you cant adjust. In addition, these birds got a downgrade from the previous game. The blue bird is utterly useless and the grey bird might as well not even be in the game. The only birds who are constantly good are the red bird and the black bird. In conclusion, this game is bad and is a shame to the original angry bird games.

There’s enough ad-filled, in-app purchase junk out there already. Please, make your games like they used to be. People will be willing to pay a few bucks up front for the game, but it’s stupid that they need to keep paying to keep playing. If you make a fun game that costs, let’s say, $3 or $4, without ads or in-app purchases, it will  still be popular. Just please stop this nonsense with ads every 30 seconds. What happened to Angry Birds 1?? Now it has ads and micro transactions, just like all your other games. Why? Just make the game cost a few bucks. For anyone else out there that agrees, write a review like this and maybe Rovio will listen this time. Also, I was banned for cheating. I have never hacked the game or any other game, so I don’t know why this happened. Fix you anti cheat software. You don’t get more plays for the game being free.

I also don’t like that they had to switch the format of everything else.

I used to casually play the game all day long at an expenditure of approx $75 a month. You could spend a great more if you wanted to advance at the maximum rate.

I ended up really upset, so I told my parents and they said it wasn’t a big deal. I never did get anything back for losing that hard-earned cash. Nowadays I earn 2 dollars a week, but that is not enough to pay for anything worth buying. I am EXTREMELY mad about everything that has happened. Even though this purchase glitch of sorts may have been removed, it could happen again. This incident happened when I was just 4-6 years old. To this day, I still remember almost every second of that awful time in my life. In total, I lost about $6 in total paying for gems (and unsuccessfully getting them.) In my situation, whenever I paid for gems, roughly 90% of the time I would get the gems I purchased, but that 10% was always there (which is why I don’t trust the devs anymore). Also, this game is ALWAYS trying to make you pay money to buy boosts or whatever is for sale at that time. A rule of this game: No boosts, no pig-popping poofs. Or completed levels. Anyways, PLEASE don’t get this game. Thank you for reading this review, and have a nice day! 🙂",

That makes this one greedy on your real-life pocketbook and I believe this version has to be connected to the internet to advance.  That is what I love about Angry Birds Starwars2 and the Space Versions among the original.  You can play the same level over and over and over till you get it right.  I miss having the option of using resources when you give up...  If Angry Birds 2 simply gave the option to redo the level until you got it right or gave in and used resources, then this version might be my favorite yet and ranked at 5stars.  Maybe the next version will be even better.  I keep buying all the Angry Birds versions.  Some are some of my favorite games I play.

There is also a lot of built in psychological pressure to spend money, for example, things turn red and tell you you lose but can buy stuff to continue playing. You can of course choose not to, but aspects of the “rewards” system and the game itself are designed to frustrate the player into buying stuff. I’m aware that apps need to make money, however, I’d prefer the option to just purchase an ad-free experience instead of being directed to ads to get rewards. Not only are there constant ads for rewards, many of the ads shown on this app include violent content including sexual assault and domestic violence against women. This is absolutely not ok! It would be great if the Angry Birds app folks exercise some discernment and stop allowing ad content that shows violence against women, especially when they require players to watch ads to get rewards.

This is when you will soon realize that the “ONLY” way to complete challenges/levels to receive rewards so that you can continue to play is by spending gems that you must purchase. One Example: to complete the daily challenge you must “Play a Clan Event” however it has timed out and requires you to pay 20 gems. Another Example: if you play the game, you will see sections repeat themselves. If you are on a regular level you can successfully beat that level, however if it is a boss level, there is rare chest involved, in an arena event or anything that promises to provide a reward, you will be unable to complete with out either paying the 60 gems to continue or running through all your hearts and then paying for gems.

However I removed it from my phone because it ate the battery, heated the phone too much and they started making some of the levels impossible to beat without spending money.  I know they are in the business to make money and I am all for a pay upfront and at major updates.  There are just too many games that follow the pay to advance model.  They get you just frustrated enough that people pay out of spite.  This new version is smaller and doesn’t heat my iPad; however, the game is no longer fun and actually is quite terrible.  I am already deleting it after a few days.  It is too difficult to advance without paying more or waiting hours upon hours. I also wish the colosseum  battles were actually live and challenging a person in real time.  The way the computer lets them have this miraculous win almost every time! You also can’t buy one last bird in that mode any longer, you can just try a rematch…..pass!",

It has multi-player battles, a never-before seen diversity in levels, spells that act like the old power-ups, but with charm, and nice cosmetics that also affect the gameplay. There are micro-transactions, but they aren’t required, as the game gives plenty more ways to get the same things. My only two complaints are very minor in my eyes, too. The lives system may be a bit of an annoyance, but it can easily be ignored if you are good at solving the challenges the game gives you. It also incentives so me to play the other modes. My other minor complaint is having to unlock the extra flock members with a bunch of feathers or through waiting, but the game helps you get the required feathers, and it doesn’t feel impossible as a result. Overall, Angry Birds 2 outshines it’s predecessors in pretty much every way, and I don’t get bored playing this game easily, either.",

If you constantly beat people way stronger than you, it will keep making it more difficult. If you, however, take the hit and lose (sometimes repeatedly) the game will revert. If you fail a certain level multiple times it will place structures that your playing style is better at and give you free birds. A tip to those who read: if you're willing to fight, and sometimes lose, don't spend your money; if you want to win fast and be the baddest bird in the roost, spend away but only after you've cleared a win streak or beat a couple bosses - you'll get special bonus packages. It's a great game with more facets than I've ever seen in online gaming while managing to stay streamlined. Enjoy!",

No longer about skill (PVP, challenges) or chance (ToF) now it’s about blatant score gouging, perfectly timed “Errors” (that don’t cause you to have to reload you just loose all prizes, streaks, and rank) and random loss of gems if you do crash. If support does respond (never) to you they may or may not replace the gems you paid RL cash for once in a while just to keep you hopeful. Basically AB2 has gained new comers in hopes of them spending money just to lose loyal players who were already spending money. I have stopped buying gems on principle alone. The only way I will pay ever again is when they have a really good special on gems (however I have lost my last 2 purchases to random error crashes and they only replaced a small portion of one) so that won’t last long.

So when you actually do get to the boss fight you’re screwed. The bosses have way too much health and it’s so annoying. And the worst part of all is that you have 5 lives and every time you lose a level a life goes away. And from what I remember the lives take about 20 minutes to refill. So you have to wait for hours for all of your lives to come back. Also, going back to the bosses, if you run out of birds but the boss is still alive the games makes you either watch an ad for 1 random bird, or it makes you waste your gems on getting 3 more birds. And if you don’t do either of those things, you lose. This game is so frustrating and annoying I uninstalled it. And I recommend you do the same. 👎🏻",

It was cool when you could hatch your own baby chick, name it, and it would give you a boost, but I’ve found it very difficult to find apples to feed my chick. Sure, they’re found in the arena, the tower of fortune, and elsewhere, but they only give you two apples when you need 5 for a level 1 bird. And if you level up your chick, it gets even harder to get enough apples before you accidentally send your chick packing. I’ve resorted to buying the apples just to keep my bird alive, and maybe that’s the games sceme, but I would enjoy the bird a whole lot more if they were easier to acquire. My suggestion is that you add a weekly apple spin to get a free chance to earn a certain number of apples. For example, once a week I open the app, and I see a Wheel of Apples to get a chance to win from 1-5 apples. I spin the spinner and I get some apples. I think this would make it easier to feed the bird.",

Tower of fortune works by giving you rewards by giving you random cards, one of them being a pig that, if clicked takes your all your loot and the only way to get it back is by paying gems. Once you pay the fee (or watch an ad) you can continue playing.  When I would play, I realized that the pigs won’t usually spawn in the same spot twice. So I used this strategy to get lots of loot and even some good hats for my birds. But this is where a problem came up.  I played and a pig was in the same spot twice. “Ok that’s fine”. I said, then I watched  the ad and went back to playing only to get the pig in the exact same spot that I had just clicked! Which means a pig was in the same spot 3 times in a row.

Like it goes from 5 apples to 10 then 25 and then to 50 that is a lot of apples. I can see that it goes up by 5 apples at every upgrade but like more than doubling it is a rip-off and that is why I have lost that baby bird multiple times. I will give it a 5 stars once this is fixed, otherwise it is a good game\n\nUpdate: I changed the stars on this game because since the recent update it freezes frequently and it is horrible. I still love and will play the game but the developers need to fix this issue ASAP. If this continues then it will leave me no choice but to uninstall which it would a shame. Please fix the freezing issue",

Discover the remote island where the greedy green pigs vacation in over 40 fun-filled levels (with more to come). You can see the incredibly realistic characters, along with the entire game, overlaid onto your actual environment, bringing Angry Birds to life like never before. Make your way up to party city through the island’s jungle, desert and frosty hideout, destroying their structures in the most spectacular way to earn maximum stars and retrieve the stolen eggs. Take the slingshot into your own hands to fire off your favorite Angry Birds at structures that seem like they are in your actual environment, whether it be your home, your office or outside at the park. \n\nWith AR, you can physically walk around structures overlaid onto objects in your own environment to find weak elements, identify different angles for the best accuracy, as well as uncover hidden surprises in order to take on the green pigs, earn more points and unlock more content. You can even make the game large or small to fit your space and customize your experience. Start the adventure today!\n\nNeed some help?

And it's free!\n\nThe Original - Play now!\n\nMeet Newton Bill, the young aspiring uphill racer. He is about to embark on a journey that takes him to where no ride has ever been before. With little respect to the laws of physics, Newton Bill will not rest until he has conquered the highest hills up on the moon!\n\nFace the challenges of many unique hill climbing environments. Gain bonuses from daring tricks and collect coins to upgrade your car and reach even higher distances. Watch out though - Bill's stout neck is not what it used to be when he was a kid! And his good ol' gasoline crematorium will easily run out of fuel.\n\nFeatures:\n- Upgradeable vehicles\n- Garage mode - Customize your vehicles\n- Lots of stages with levels to reach in each\n- Cool graphics and smooth physics simulation\n- Designed to look good on low resolution and high resolution devices (incl. tablets)\n- Real turbo sound when you upgrade your engine!\n\nVehicles: Hill Climber, motocross bike, monster truck, tractor, hippie van, onewheeler, quad bike, tourist bus, race car, police car, ambulance, fire truck, snow mobile, super offroad, and many more!\n\nHill Climb Racing is free to play and offline but there are optional in-app purchases available.\n\nRemember that we're always reading your feedback and are hard at work creating new vehicles, levels, features and of course fixing any issues you may find. So we'd really appreciate if you'd report what you like or dislike and any issues you may have with the game to support@fingersoft.com and please include your device make and model.\n\nFollow Us:\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fingersoft\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/HCR_Official_\n* Website: https://www.fingersoft.com\n* Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hillclimbracing_official\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/fingersoft\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://fingersoft.com/eula-web/\nPrivacy Policy: https://fingersoft.com/privacy-policy/\n\n\nHill Climb Racing is a registered trademark of Fingersoft Ltd.

Each table - Wild West, The Deep, Jungle Style, Slayer, Da Vinci, Missing In Action, Navy Seals and Platoon - are masterpieces. You'll be stunned with the level of realism.

Tap the circled \"I\" at the bottom right of each table to get a display detailing instructions and descriptions of the features of each table. Make sure to swipe left and right when viewing since the instructions don't fit on one screen.\n• Local and global high scores.

At the end of each game you are prompted to enter your name and have your score included.\n• Unique soundtrack with atmospheric music, sound effects and voices.\n• Camera tilt brings dimensionality to the games offering a simulated 3D effect where the image changes depending upon how you tilt the iPad. Camera tilt only works in landscape mode.\n• Stereoscopic imaging option (requires anaglyph eyeglasses).

He’s hanging out at his buddy’s bar with a bunch of his friends for his birthday party.  They’re all laughing and singing and partying and having a great time.  When all of a sudden, out of nowhere:  Crash, Boom, Bang, Smash, Slam, Boom, Crash…it’s like the fourth of July is going off in a garbage can. There are cops all over the place.  They bust in all full of piss and vinegar. They grab Ogre, drag him out and throw him in the back of squad car.  Bing, Bang, Boom and just like that…they’re gone.\n\nNow, needless to say Ogre’s friends are pissed (in every sense of the word.)  Not only are they drunk.  Now they’re angry.  So, naturally, they have to get him out of custody.  That’s where you come in.  You have to help Ogre’s friends throw their beverage of choice at the cops and knock them out.  You need to take out everyone and everything.  That includes dogs, horses, squad cars, monster trucks, you name it.  You have to take them out and get Ogre back to that party.  Otherwise, it ain’t no Happy Birthday.\n\nSo, download and load up.  Because Ogre has a pint waiting for him.",
