        "response": "The 'Google Places' API within this tool enables users to parse Google Local and Maps results for local business listings. Utilizing the 'search_type=places' parameter, users can tap into places_results array which contains the results from a Google Local results page or a Google Maps results page, depending on how the location is set. To conduct a search on a Google Local results page, a textual location name is required, which can be obtained via the Locations API. This search might resemble a typical search conducted on https://www.google.com with certain parameters set to refine the results to a specific area and language, such as 'pizza' in 'Manhattan, New York'. On the other hand, searching via Google Maps results requires latitude, longitude, and a zoom level, targeting the search in a more map-centric manner, as if one were to search on https://www.google.com/maps at a specific map location and zoom level for 'pizza'. Both modes are designed to help users find detailed information about local businesses pertaining to their query."
