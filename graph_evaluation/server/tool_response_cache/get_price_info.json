    "response": "The TEXTKING Translation API received your request for translating a 1000-word document from English (en) to French (fr) with the topic being 'business.' This service will facilitate the translation through professional human translators who specialize in business-related content to ensure industry-specific terminology and nuances are accurately conveyed in the target language. Our process includes initial translation by a qualified linguist, followed by proofreading by another translator for quality assurance. We strive to maintain the original message's integrity while considering cultural sensitivities and local business practices to provide a localized translation that resonates with your French-speaking audience. The translated document will undergo multiple quality checks and revisions if necessary, to meet your expectations and our quality standards. Once the translation is complete, the document will be made available for you to review and approve. You will also have the ability to request further revisions to ensure the translation meets your specific needs. Please note, turnaround times may vary based on the complexity of the topic and current translator availability, but typically, a 1000-word document can be translated within 2-3 business days. We will provide an estimate for the completion date and notify you of the project's progress throughout the translation process. If you have specific deadlines or require expedited service, please let us know, and we will do our best to accommodate your requirements."

    "response": "The TEXTKING Translation API has successfully received your request to translate a 500-word document from English (en) to French (fr). The identification of the topic as '23e59a46-2937-4800-ae0a-5a61b33bca6e' appears to be a unique identifier rather than a descriptive topic name. If this is referencing a specific subject matter or project within your organization, we will coordinate with you to ensure we understand the context and requirements associated with this identifier. If this was an error and you intended to provide a specific topic name, please update your request accordingly. Our team of professional human translators is equipped to handle a wide range of topics, ensuring that the translation is not only linguistically accurate but also contextually relevant to the subject matter. Once we have the correct topic details, we will match your project with a translator who has expertise in that area. The translation process includes an initial translation phase, followed by a comprehensive proofreading by another expert to ensure the highest quality outcome. Cultural nuances, industry-specific terminology, and the intended message of your original document will be preserved and conveyed appropriately in French. Translation projects are monitored for quality control and go through various checks before delivery. A standard 500-word document translation typically requires 1-2 business days. We will provide you with a timeline for completion, and keep you updated on the project's status.
