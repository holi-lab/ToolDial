        "response": "The 'getSubtitleLanguages' API is designed to retrieve a comprehensive list of all subtitle languages available for TED talks. This API enables users to find out in which languages they can access subtitles when they are watching a TED talk, thereby enhancing accessibility and understanding across a global audience. Subtitling is vital for non-native English speakers and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Understanding subtitles' language availability helps users choose talks that they can fully understand and enjoy.\n\nThrough this API, users can expect to receive a list of language codes according to ISO 639-1 standards, for example, 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish, 'de' for German, etc. The list may include widely spoken languages globally, as well as less commonly spoken ones, provided they are available in the TED talks subtitle database. It is important to note that the availability of subtitles in various languages for a specific TED talk can vary and not all talks may have a wide range of subtitles.\n\nThe API does not require any input parameters since it is structured to return a universal set of data\u2014the list of all subtitle languages\u2014that does not change based on user inputs. Therefore, regardless of the request sent, the response will consist of a consistent and comprehensive list of available subtitle languages that can be used to filter TED talks according to the viewer's language preference."
