The nation's resilient economy, characterized by a diverse market and a solid consumer base, is anticipated to maintain growth. Despite external pressures such as fluctuating commodity prices and trade tensions, local economists predict a steady rise in GDP. However, cautious optimism is advised as policymakers and businesses navigate the uncertain landscape. Key sectors such as manufacturing, services, and digital economy are poised for expansion, while the government's infrastructure push aims to bolster long-term growth. With eyes on the upcoming G20 Summit hosted in Bali, Indonesia's role in the global economy is more pronounced than ever, fostering discussions on sustainable development and inclusive progress."
