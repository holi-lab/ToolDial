        "response": "The Major League Soccer Standings API provides current standings of all the teams participating in the Major League Soccer. The standings typically include information such as the team names, games played (GP), wins (W), losses (L), draws (D), goals for (GF), goals against (GA), goal difference (GD), and total points (PTS). Standings are vital for fans, analysts, and soccer enthusiasts to track the performance of their favorite teams throughout the season. The standings are updated regularly following the conclusion of matches to reflect the most recent outcomes. Since no specific details are provided in your request, the API would generally return a list of all the MLS teams along with their respective statistics and current positions in a formatted table. For a more detailed response, please provide specific parameters such as the desired season, date, or additional filters to tailor the response to particular standings information."
