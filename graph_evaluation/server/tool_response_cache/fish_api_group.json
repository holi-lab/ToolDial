    "response": "The data for the scientific classification 'class' with the property value 'actinopterygii' has been grouped. Actinopterygii, or ray-finned fishes, represent a diverse class of fishes constituting over half of the living vertebrate species. They are characterized by the presence of bony spines (ray) in their fins which serve both for locomotion and stabilization. This group includes a wide range of species, from small freshwater fishes like guppies and tetras to large marine species like tunas and marlins.  The collection consists of species like the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), clownfish (Amphiprioninae), and the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) amongst many others. The data are compiled from the latest available information on Wikipedia and are refreshed every 24 hours to ensure the most up-to-date classification and species information."
