        "response": "The API you are trying to access has the function to retrieve trend keywords from a selection of 50 regions, with the data going back to May 18, 2023. This API may be particularly useful for researchers, marketers, and businesses that are interested in understanding regional trends and leveraging this information for various strategic purposes. Unfortunately, your input did not contain any specific parameters, such as 'region' or 'date', which are commonly required for such APIs to return relevant data. Typically, you would need to specify at least one region from the available list and a date to see the trending keywords for that time. If you're interested in multiple regions or a range of dates, those parameters might need to be included in your request as well. Please refer to the full API documentation to construct a valid API call with the necessary input parameters. Once you provide valid input, you can expect to receive a list of trending keywords for the specified region(s) and time period, formatted according to the API's response structure."
