These thumbnails facilitate easier browsing and selection of 3D models, particularly in scenarios where network resources are limited or when a high number of models need to be displayed at once. Moreover, the thumbnail serves as a visual identifier, making it straightforward to distinguish between various 3D assets in digital libraries or asset management systems."
