        "response": "The 'GET /datasources' API call retrieves a list of all data sources associated with a user's account in the context of building an IoT sensor application with Ubidots. Data sources can include various types of devices, such as environmental monitors, smart home controllers, industrial machinery, and any other connected hardware from which you are collecting data. Each data source in the returned list typically provides metadata including the name of the device, its label, context, last activity timestamp, creation date, number of associated variables (sensors), and other configurable details such as device type and connectivity status. If the user has no data sources, the response would return an empty list. This function is crucial for users to get an overview of all the devices they have in their network, and to manage or analyze the incoming data streams from each source."
