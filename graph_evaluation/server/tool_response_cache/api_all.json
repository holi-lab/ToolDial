    "response": "The '/api/all' endpoint is designed to fetch a comprehensive list of all movie sessions currently available across Cinemas NOS, a chain of movie theaters in Portugal. This includes details on movie titles, showtimes, respective theater locations, and potentially other session-specific information such as auditorium numbers, seat availability, and pricing information. Each movie listing would provide the necessary details to help moviegoers plan their cinema visit, including the film's genre, duration, and rating, as well as any special formats it may be presented in, like IMAX or 3D. The objective is to present a complete snapshot of all movie experiences on offer, allowing users to find their preferred showings at convenient times and locations. The data returned would likely be structured with individual movie entries, each containing nested arrays of showtimes organized by theater. This would facilitate easy browsing and selection by the end-users who utilize this API to access up-to-date scheduling information. Additionally, the API might offer filtering capabilities to allow users to sort by genre, location, or showtime, though this functionality is not explicitly mentioned in the provided API documentation excerpt."
