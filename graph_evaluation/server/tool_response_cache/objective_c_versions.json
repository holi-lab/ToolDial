These include, but may not be limited to, C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20. Each version introduces new features, optimizations, and fixes, allowing developers to choose the standard that best fits their project's requirements. Additionally, experimental or upcoming versions may be supported under a preview feature, such as C++23; however, the stability and completeness of support for experimental versions can vary and should be used with caution in production environments. Users of the API can specify their desired C++ version when compiling code to ensure compatibility and take advantage of the features provided by that version."

        "response": "Welcome to the C++ Code Compiler API. This service is designed to compile C++ code by providing an interface that supports multiple versions of the C++ language standard, enabling developers to compile source code according to specific project requirements. To use this API, developers are expected to submit their C++ source code along with the desired compilation settings, including the version of the C++ standard to use, any compiler flags, optimization levels, and more. The API processes the source code and returns the compilation result, which may include executable binaries, intermediate object files, or error messages and warnings, depending on the outcome of the compilation process and the configuration requested. Our API ensures high performance and compatibility across various platforms and C++ standards, aiding in developers' productivity and project efficiency. To get started, please submit your code along with the preceding information as input parameters in a JSON formatted request."
