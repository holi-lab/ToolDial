Please configure your application or tool to route traffic through this proxy using the provided host and port. Note that this proxy will accept connections only from the source IP that made this API call. If you require a connection from a different source IP, you may use the 'whitelist_ip' parameter in a separate API call to add it to the accepted list. For specific country targeting, use the 'countries' parameter during the API request to choose from available options as listed on the *Service Status* endpoint. Ensure to keep note of the expiration timestamp as this proxy will cease to function after the noted time unless you make a successive API call to extend its allocation time."
