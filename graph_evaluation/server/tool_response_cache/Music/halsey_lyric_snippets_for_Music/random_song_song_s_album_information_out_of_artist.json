          "They told me once, nothing grows\nWhen a house ain't a home\nIs it true, honestly",
          "Is it true, honestly\nWhen it's\u2005all\u2005a part of\u2005me?",
          "A couple years of waiting rooms\nFinding\u2005God, and lose Him too",
          "Finding\u2005God, and lose Him too\nWanna scream, but what's the use?",
          "Lyin' awake, and I stare at the door\nI just can't take it no more",
          "They told me it's useless, there's no hope in store\nBut somehow I just want you more",
          "I want you more\nSomehow, I just want you more",
          "Wooden floors and little feet\nA flower bud in concrete",
          "Feelin' so incomplete\nWonder will we ever meet?",
          "And would you know it right away\nHow hard I tried to see your face?",
          "How hard I tried to see your face?\nA little screen, a photograph, mine to take",
          "I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer\nI cry and my knuckles get sore",
          "'Cause I still believe it won't be like before\nAnd now, somehow, I just want you more",
          "And when you decide it's your time to arrive\nI've loved you for all of my life",
          "And nothing could stop me from giving a try\nI've loved you for all of my life"
