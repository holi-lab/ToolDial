        "Don't call me by my name\nAll of this is temporary\nWatch as I slip away for your sake\nAll of this is temporary",
        "Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark\nYou won't even notice me depart\nSecondhand thread in a secondhand bed\nWith a second man's head",
        "Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark\nYou won't even notice me depart",
        "Leavin' through the door without a word\nYou won't even notice, little bird",
        "Leavin' through the door without a word\nYou won't even notice, little bird\nBetter off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead",
        "So don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah\nIt's not a happy ending",
        "Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah\nIt's not a happy ending",
        "Jesus needed a three-day weekend\nTo sort out all his bullshit, figur\u0435 out the treason\nI've been s\u0435arching for a fortified defense\nFour to five reasons",
        "But Jesus, you've got better lips than Judas\nI could keep your bed warm, otherwise, I'm useless\nI don't really mean it 'cause who the fuck would choose this?",
        "You won't even notice, little bird\nBetter off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead",
