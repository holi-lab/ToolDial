          "She doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore\n'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get",
          "She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore\nToo scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me",
          "When I wake up all alone\nAnd I'm thinking of your skin",
          "I remember, I remember what you told me",
          "Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers",
          "With the same damn hunger\nTo be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all",
          "We're not lovers, we're just strangers",
          "She doesn't call me on the phone anymore\nShe's never listening, she says it's innocent",
          "She doesn't let me have control anymore\nI must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind",
          "When I wake up all alone\nAnd I'm thinking of your skin\nI remember, I remember what you told me",
          "I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed",
          "I miss the memories replaying in my head",
          "I miss the thought of a forever, you and me\nBut all you're missing is my body, oh"
