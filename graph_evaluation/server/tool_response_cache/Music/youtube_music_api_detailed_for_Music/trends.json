Since the input specifies the country code 'ZZ', which is not a valid ISO country code, the API would not be able to provide specific trending information for that region. Normally, for a valid country code, the response would include region-specific trends. The global charts typically feature broad trends without focusing on trending sections, while the US charts include an extra Genres section showcasing trends within specific music genres."
