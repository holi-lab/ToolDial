        "error": "",
        "response": "The 'RotateFlipImage' API call with the method 'Rotate90FlipY' has been applied to 'photo.jpg'. This operation rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise and then flips it along the vertical axis. The resulting image is saved under the 'edited_images' folder with the same file name 'photo.jpg'. This function is particularly useful when you need to adjust the orientation of an image for consistent viewing across different platforms or correct images that were taken in portrait mode but need to be displayed in landscape mode, or vice versa. The image transformation preserves the original quality of 'photo.jpg', ensuring that the resultant image maintains the integrity of colors and resolution after the rotation and flip operations."

        "error": "",
        "response": "The 'RotateFlipImage' API call with the method 'Rotate90FlipX' has been applied to 'photo.jpg'. During this process, the image undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation followed by a horizontal flip. The modified image is then stored within the 'edited_images' directory, retaining the original file name 'photo.jpg'. This transformation is valuable for correcting the orientation of images to meet particular requirements, such as ensuring consistent presentation or adjusting the layout to better fit specific formats or compositions. Throughout this operation, the quality of the original 'photo.jpg' is preserved, ensuring that the finished image sustains the fidelity of its colors, details, and overall resolution despite the manipulation."
