By calling this endpoint, you would receive information on various video formats that you can use to convert your original videos. This would typically include formats such as AVI, MP4, WMV, FLV, MOV, and many more, each potentially with different resolutions, bit rates, codecs, and containers to ensure compatibility with a wide range of devices and platforms. The response would also detail the specifications for each format, enabling you to make informed decisions on the best format to suit your needs, whether it's for streaming, archival, or sharing on different networks. This ability to encode to many formats is crucial for reaching the broadest audience possible, as it takes into account the diverse ecosystem of devices and software that your viewers might be using."
