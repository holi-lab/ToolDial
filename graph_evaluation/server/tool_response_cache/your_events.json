        "response": "To retrieve a list of events owned or accessible by the current token holder with the 'Your Events' API, an appropriately scoped token is required. Normally, you would provide this token as part of the authorization headers in the API request. Since no specific input parameters were provided in your request, a generic response can be given that outlines the typical information returned by such an API call. The response would typically include details such as event IDs, event names, dates, times, locations, ticket types, sales status, and potentially the number of attendees. Each event is expected to have a unique identifier which can be used to access more detailed information or to perform actions such as updating event details or managing attendees. Without an actual token, no real data can be accessed or returned; however, once an authenticated request is made, the API would respond with the specific data tied to the current token holder's accessible events."
