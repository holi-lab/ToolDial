        "response": "In the world of Lost Ark, sailors are valuable assets for players who want to explore the vast oceans and engage in naval activities. Each sailor comes with a unique set of skills and traits that can enhance the performance of a player's ship in various ways, such as improving sailing speed, increasing resistance to certain environmental effects, or providing expertise in specific maritime tasks. To obtain a list of all available sailors in Lost Ark, their details usually include, but are not limited to, the sailor's name, class, rarity, required level, skillset, and any associated bonuses they confer to the ship or crew. By having this information, a player can make informed decisions on which sailors to recruit to optimize their naval expeditions, balancing their crew's composition to suit either combat, trading, exploration, or other specialized endeavors on the high seas."
