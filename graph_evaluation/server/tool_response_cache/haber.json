        "response": "This REST API, developed using Python and Flask, offers access to the latest news articles from 'ntv.com.tr'. It's designed to provide clients with timely and up-to-date news information. The 'Haber' API endpoint would typically allow users to retrieve the latest national and international news headlines, along with detailed news content such as the publication date, article summary, and possibly multimedia elements like images or videos relating to the news stories. Users can expect a structured JSON response containing an array of news items, where each item includes relevant details like the title, link, summary, and other metadata. This service is particularly useful for news aggregators, media monitoring tools, or applications that require integration of current events content in real-time. The API might also support filtering capabilities to access specific types of news based on categories such as politics, economy, sports, or technology, and might allow for pagination to enable handling large sets of news data."
