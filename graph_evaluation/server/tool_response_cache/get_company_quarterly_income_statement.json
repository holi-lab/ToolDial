The total revenue figures display the company's gross sales and income from its business activities, while the cost of revenue represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. These figures lead to the gross profit, which is indicative of the profit a company makes after deducting the costs directly associated with the production and sales of its products. Research and development (R&D) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) are also reported, highlighting the company's investment in the advancement of its products and operational costs. Operating income illustrates the profit earned from regular business operations, and net income reflects the total profit or loss after all expenses have been deducted from total revenues."
