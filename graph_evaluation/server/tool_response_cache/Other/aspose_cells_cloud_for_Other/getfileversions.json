However, for Excel documents located at the specified path, the 'GetFileVersions' API can retrieve a list of file versions available in the cloud storage. It allows tracking of document edits over time by maintaining different versions of the Excel files. For your '.docx' file, consider utilizing Aspose.Words Cloud, another component of Aspose's cloud services specifically designed for Word document operations, including version tracking."
