However, the input provided specifies a path to a '.docx' file, which is typically a Word document. Aspose.Cells Cloud primarily deals with Excel document formats such as XLS and XLSX, and operations related to them, including conversion to formats like PDF, HTML, ODS, XPS, CSV, etc. If '/report.docx' is indeed intended to be an Excel document mistakenly named with a '.docx' extension, please ensure the file format is correct for Excel operations. Otherwise, for operations on Word documents, Aspose.Words Cloud would be the appropriate tool. Please verify the file path and format for the intended operation."
