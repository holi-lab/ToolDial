Once connected, the 'Get all Contacts' API fetches the complete list of contacts, sorting them in alphabetical order based on their names. This list would typically include names, phone numbers, email addresses, and possibly additional information such as addresses or roles within the Church. However, since no specific input parameters were provided for this API call, the response would include all contacts stored in ChurchApp. For more customized queries or to fetch specific sets of contacts, additional input parameters may need to be specified according to the API's capabilities."
