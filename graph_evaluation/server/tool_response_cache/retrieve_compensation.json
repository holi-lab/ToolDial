    "{'is_id': 'specific_compensation_id'}": {
        "error": "",
        "response": "The input received appears to be an 'is_id' which seems to be meant for identifying a specific compensation record, possibly within a human resources or payroll management context. However, the API documentation describes the API as one that contains fuel rates for every city in India and has the capability to show the fuel price for a particular city. There seems to be a discrepancy between the input received and the API's intended function. A correct API input to retrieve fuel prices should likely include the name of the city or some geographical identifier, such as a city ID or a zip code, rather than a compensation ID. Without the appropriate city-related input, this API cannot provide the fuel rate of a specific city. To correct this, please provide a valid input parameter that specifies the city for which the fuel rate information is required. For example, an appropriate input might be {'city_name': 'New Delhi'} to receive the current fuel price of New Delhi, India."

    "{'is_id': '<specific_compensation_id>'}": {
        "error": "Incorrect input parameter provided.",
        "response": "The input received as 'is_id' does not align with the functionality of this API. The 'is_id' parameter suggests an ID for a specific compensation record, which is unrelated to fuel rates. This API is designed to provide fuel rates for cities within India. To retrieve the correct information, please submit an input that includes a valid city name or geographical identifier related to the fuel pricing data. For instance, a valid input format to obtain the current fuel price would be {'city_name': 'Mumbai'}, where 'Mumbai' is the city you are inquiring about. If you're unsure of which cities are supported, feel free to provide the name of any major city in India and the system will return the latest available fuel rates for that location."
