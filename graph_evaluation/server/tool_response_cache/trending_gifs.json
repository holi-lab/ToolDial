        "response": "The 'Trending GIFs' API endpoint provides access to a list of GIFs that are currently popular and widely shared across the internet. These GIFs reflect the most recent trends, memes, and cultural moments, capturing what is generating interest and amusement in the digital space at this moment. By leveraging this API, you can retrieve a default set of 25 trending GIFs, which could include a mix of different content ranging from reaction GIFs, festive celebrations, trending catchphrases, or snippets from viral videos. The data structure of the response would typically include unique identifiers for each GIF, URLs to the GIF files, titles, hashtags, and potentially any metadata associated with the GIFs, such as the source, content rating, and upload date. This endpoint is valuable for social media applications, messaging platforms, or any digital service looking to enrich the user experience with dynamic and engaging visual content. The integration with CORS enables seamless implementation within web applications to offer users a fresh and updated selection of GIFs with minimal latency. No input parameters were provided, so the API will return the default trending set."
