        "response": "The 'List Passes' API function within the PassSlot tool provides developers with the ability to retrieve a list of all passbook passes that have been created and maintained through the service. The API would likely return a collection of pass objects with their details, such as pass type identifier, serial numbers, associated URLs, barcodes, and other metadata that defines a passbook pass. Each object represents a digital pass that can be stored within a user's passbook application. This functionality is essential for developers to manage and keep track of the passes that are being distributed to end-users, allowing for operations such as updates, invalidations, and analytics on pass usage. Since the tool is described as easy to use, developers can expect straightforward and well-documented API endpoints to handle their passbook integration needs. The expected result from a call to this API, when passes exist, would be a JSON array of pass objects, detailing each pass's attributes and current state."
