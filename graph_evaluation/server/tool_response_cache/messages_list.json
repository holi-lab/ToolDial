        "response": "The 'Messages: List' API within VerticalResponse is designed to retrieve a list of all messages that have been created for email campaigns. When a request is made to this API, it typically returns information about each message, including details such as the message ID, subject, sender, status (draft, sent, scheduled), creation date, and statistics like open rates and click-through rates if the campaign has already been sent. This data enables users to overview their email campaign messages and perform actions like analyzing performance, editing drafts, resending messages, or planning new campaigns based on the insights. This API would typically support pagination to help with the management of large sets of messages, allowing the developer to specify parameters such as 'page number' and 'page size' to retrieve messages in a more organized and manageable way. Filters such as date range, status, and search keywords may also be available to narrow down the list to more specific sets of messages. The resulting JSON array of message objects would be useful for a variety of in-app features related to campaign management and reporting. Since no specific input parameters were provided, the response here is a general overview of what you could typically expect from the 'Messages: List' API endpoint in VerticalResponse."
