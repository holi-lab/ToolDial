        "response": "The 'Articles by Single Source' API allows users to focus their search on articles related to energy prices from a specific news outlet. By providing the 'sourceid' parameter, the API filters through various news sources to retrieve articles exclusively from the specified outlet. This functionality is particularly useful for users who prefer the reporting style, credibility, or depth of coverage of a particular news source. For instance, if the 'sourceid' is set to 'source_id', the API will return a collection of recent articles from that source, discussing topics such as changes in oil, gas, and renewable energy prices, market trends, and expert analyses. This targeted approach helps users stay informed about energy price movements through the lens of their trusted news outlet."
