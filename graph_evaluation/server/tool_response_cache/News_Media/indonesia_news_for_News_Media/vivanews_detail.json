        "response": "Given the API aims to provide data from major news websites in Indonesia, the 'vivanews-detail' functionality appears to fetch detailed content from Viva News based on an article's ID. For the input 'is_id': 1612364, the expected output would typically include the article's detail such as the publication date, title, content, author, and possibly multimedia associated with it. Additionally, it may also fetch details on related articles that could interest the reader, offering links or summaries of these articles. Lastly, there's a component dedicated to the comment list to show reader interactions, feedback, or discussions about the primary article. However, the placeholder response suggests no specific data has been returned for the provided example IDs, which might either indicate unavailability of data for these IDs or a requirement for a more effective query formulation. For a real scenario, the API should return structured details concerning the article identified by ID 1612364, including its content, related articles, and comments, all aimed at enriching the user's reading experience."
