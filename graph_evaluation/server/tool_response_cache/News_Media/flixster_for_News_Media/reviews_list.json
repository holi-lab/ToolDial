              "comment": "After the shift in theme and tone of Thor: Ragnorak, I was pumped to see what Taika Waititi would do with Thor: Love and Thunder especially when it was said that Natalie Portman would return in her role as Jane, the Guardians of the Galaxy would be appearing, and Christian Bale would be playing the villain! Who knew the apple could fall so far from the tree, Waititi takes what was great about Ragnorak and doubles down on everything, especially the comedy. The movie sets itself up to be a great and compelling movie as the introduction of Gorr and the opening sequence with the Guardians was great. And about after 15 or so minutes, the Guardians are gone, and the film goes about downhill from there. The movie insists on placing these untimely jokes every few minutes which by not even the halfway mark in what is a movie that just barely scratches the surface of two hours ends up getting annoying and leaves you waiting for the movie to end. Chris Hemsworth is great as always as I think he has been great in the role since the beginning and has adjusted to so many different iterations of the character and Christian Bale gives the best performance, he can with the poor script he was given. The movie like other Marvel films relies heavily on CGI which is very poorly done in this film. Taika Watiti as good as Thor: Ragnorak was, might be a one hit wonder, at least in the MCU."

First off, Heath Ledger is the second best Joker, topped only slightly by Mark Hamill. The rest of the cast is honestly perfect, too. The conflict between Batman and Joker is masterfully crafted, not to mention Harvey's character arc. And so many iconic and beautifully written scenes. If you've somehow never seen the movie, do it as soon as you can (but don't forget to watch Batman Begins first, of course, if you've somehow never seen that one either)."

While Batman is in many ways overshadowed by the amazing supporting cast in this film I love how the complex message only fits a character like him - in line with this the title is quite brilliant. The Joker's impact on the narrative is largely what makes the movie so damn good and Heath Ledger's performance is deserving of its legendary reputation. To this day The Dark Knight is probably still the very best  Superhero movies can offer."

Incredible story, exhilarating action, fantastic performances from a talented cast, ESPECIALLY Heath Ledger, putting in one of the best performances ever as the Joker. It is a flawless film, the best of one of the greatest trilogies of all time. It further proves that Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest talents working today."
