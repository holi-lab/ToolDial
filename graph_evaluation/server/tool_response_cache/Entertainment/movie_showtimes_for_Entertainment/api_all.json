        "response": "The API '/api/all' retrieves a comprehensive list of all movie sessions across all the available movies being shown in Cinemas NOS, a popular chain of movie theaters in Portugal. It provides detailed information including movie titles, their genres, the various showtimes at different locations, theater names, and the available screening formats such as 2D, 3D, IMAX, etc. The response brings together a convenient compilation of data to help moviegoers plan their cinema outings by offering a bird's eye view of what's playing where and at what times, all across the Cinemas NOS network. This API is particularly useful for planning group outings or for those looking to catch the latest movies without having to navigate through each cinema's schedule individually."
