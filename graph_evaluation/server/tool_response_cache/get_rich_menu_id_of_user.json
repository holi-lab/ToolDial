With this ID, you can further manage user-specific rich menus, like updating the content, changing the layout, or potentially unsetting the menu if needed. Note that rich menus are a powerful feature in LINE Messaging API as they provide a more interactive and engaging way to communicate with the users by offering multiple pre-defined actions available at the tap of a button. You can customize these menus extensively based on your application's needs and the user's preferences."
