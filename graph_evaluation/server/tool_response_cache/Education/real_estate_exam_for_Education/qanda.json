Another test to determine whether an item is a fixture is whether the item is so adapted to the real property, that to remove the item will diminish the value or utility of the real property. Of course, if the purchase contract specifically includes a certain item with the sale of the property, that item must be regarded as a fixture, whether it meets the legal definition of fixture or not. Likewise if the purchase contract specifically excludes an item from the sale, it must be regarded as personal property, and should be removed.\",\"choiceId\":5,\"choiceDescription\":\"a fixture\"},{\"questionId\":2,\"typeDescription\":\"MultipleChoice\",\"questionDescription\":\"Which of the following lists correctly describes the physical and economic characteristics of real estate?\",\"tags\":\"Characteristics\",\"feedback\":\"Land is characterized as immovable because an entire parcel of real estate cannot be moved to another site.

Despite there being a lot of land, land is considered scarce as brand-new parcels of land cannot be created through human labor. D is incorrect. Land is not considered moveable.
