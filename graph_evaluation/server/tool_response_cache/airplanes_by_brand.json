Another significant model is the Boeing 747, known as the 'Queen of the Skies,' which revolutionized long-haul travel with its iconic hump. Boeing's 777 series is known for its long range and twin-engine efficiency, which has made it a favorite for long-haul flights. The 787 Dreamliner series is Boeing's most modern addition, renowned for its fuel efficiency and advanced aerodynamics, which allow it to serve long-haul routes with better economics and passenger comfort. The Boeing 757 and 767 lines, while no longer in production, continue to operate globally and are valued for their reliability and performance in both commercial and cargo roles."
