The 'Get Producto Promo' API typically requires parameters such as product ID, customer segment, or promo code to return the promotional details of a product. Without such parameters, the API cannot determine which product's promotional information to return or what kind of promotion applies. Please ensure to include relevant input parameters, such as product identification details and any other criteria important for fetching specific promotional information. This will enable the API to generate a specific response concerning available promotions or discounts on a product."
