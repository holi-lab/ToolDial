A session has been initiated incorporating the 'America/Los_Angeles' timezone to accommodate the user\u2019s local time for any timestamp-related functionalities. Since an empty user agent 'web' has been supplied, it is advised to provide a distinguishable user agent string representing the browser or the system from which the API is being accessed for better compatibility and security audit purposes. A session ID has been assigned for maintaining the state of the interaction, which must be used in all future requests for authentication persistence. Please ensure that the session ID is stored securely and that all communication with the API is conducted over a secure channel such as HTTPS to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the user data. Note that sessions may have a fixed expiry, and without activity, the user may be required to re-authenticate. Remember to refresh or renew the session according to the platform's guidelines to maintain seamless access."
