        "response": "Our backorder service enables users to access a list of expiring domain names that may be valuable for their business or personal projects. The 'backorders' API provides a real-time feed of domain names that are nearing the end of their registration period and are likely to become available for new registration. By leveraging this service, users have the opportunity to claim domains that could be critical for SEO, branding, or other strategic initiatives.\n\nUsers can specify criteria such as domain age, keyword relevance, TLD (Top-Level Domain), or rankings to filter and find the most advantageous domains. This API would typically respond with a list containing domain names, their expiration dates, current registrar, and additional metadata that may assist users in making informed decisions regarding domain backorders. This list is frequently updated to reflect the dynamic nature of domain name availability.\n\nPlease note that as the current API call did not include any specific input parameters, the resulting response would include a general list of upcoming domain names available for backorder. For more targeted results, users should provide additional parameters such as 'keywords', 'TLDs', 'domain age', 'traffic rank', or 'budget' to refine the search."
