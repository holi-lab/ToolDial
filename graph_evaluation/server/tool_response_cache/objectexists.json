    "response": "The 'ObjectExists' API in the Aspose.Diagram tool checks for the existence of a particular object within a Visio document. When provided with the path '/documents/diagrams/flowchart.vdx', this API would verify whether the specified Visio file (flowchart.vdx) exists in the given directory. If the file is found, the API would confirm its presence. Conversely, if the file is not located in the specified path, the API would report that the object does not exist. The outcome of this operation enables users or other services to confirm the existence of diagram files before attempting further operations, such as opening, editing, or converting the file to another format. The response does not specify the contents of the diagram but provides a simple existence check, streamlining the workflow for users by preventing errors that could occur when referencing non-existent files in automated processes."

    "error": "",
    "response": "The 'ObjectExists' API in the Aspose.Diagram tool is utilized to determine the existence of a given file within a Visio document. Given the input path '/designs/design.vsdx', the API performs a search operation in the specified directory. The aim is to locate the design.vsdx file and confirm its presence. Should the file be available in the directory, the API will provide a positive response indicating the file exists. On the contrary, if the search concludes that the file is not present at the given path, the API will respond accordingly, indicating that the object does not exist. This verification step is crucial before performing any tasks that require interaction with the file, such as editing or transforming its format. The API's response is focused on the existence check and does not include details about the file's content or its structure. It ensures that subsequent operations are executed on valid files, enhancing the robustness of automated processes and reducing the likelihood of errors due to file absence."

However, the input you've provided specifies a path to a document with a '.docx' extension, which is typically associated with Microsoft Word documents, not Excel files. The Aspose.Cells Cloud is specialized for operations with Excel documents (e.g., '.xls', '.xlsx'). If '/report.docx' were an Excel file and you provided the correct path and file extension, the API would return information about the existence of the file in the specified location. If the document does exist, you would receive a response confirming its existence, and if not, the response would indicate that the file could not be found. Since '/report.docx' is not an Excel file, the API may not be able to process it correctly. Please ensure that you provide the correct file path and extension for an Excel document to use this API effectively."

This API is specifically designed to work within the confines of Excel file formats and operations. Once a proper path is provided, the API can indicate whether the specified path points to an existing object in the cloud storage.

The object you have queried is 'report.docx' which appears to be a Microsoft Word document. This API is specifically tailored to handle Excel documents with extensions such as '.xls' or '.xlsx'. To correctly use the service, please provide a valid Excel file path. For instance, if you are checking whether an Excel report exists, make sure the file path ends with either '.xls' or '.xlsx', like '/folder/report.xlsx'. The API would then check if the Excel file exists at the specified location in the cloud storage. If the file does exist, a positive confirmation would be returned, while a non-existence case would yield a 'file not found' response. If 'report.docx' is indeed an Excel file but just misnamed, renaming it with the correct extension and providing the updated path would be necessary to proceed with the 'ObjectExists' API call."

As previously mentioned, the Aspose.Cells Cloud service is dedicated to operations concerning Excel documents, which typically have the '.xls' or '.xlsx' file extensions. The file you are inquiring about has a '.docx' extension, which is usually associated with Microsoft Word documents. For the 'ObjectExists' API to function correctly, you must specify a path to an Excel document. If 'report.docx' was meant to be an Excel file, please ensure to correct the file extension before making the request (for example, 'report.xlsx'). Once the file path and extension are accurate for an Excel document, the API can then properly determine if the file exists within the Aspose.Cells Cloud storage. If it does, a positive confirmation will be returned; if not, you will be informed that the file cannot be found. Please verify the file name and extension and re-submit your request accordingly."

Please provide a valid Excel file path with the correct extension to check if the file exists in the cloud storage. For example, you can input 'report.xlsx' or 'data.xls' if those are the files you intend to check. If the file path and extension are correct and the file exists on the Aspose.Cells Cloud, the API will affirm its existence. If the file does not exist or the path is invalid, it will return a response indicating the file could not be found.

The provided input includes a file with a '.docx' extension, which indicates a Microsoft Word document rather than an Excel file. Additionally, you have included a 'storagename' in the input, which is used to specify the storage location. Assuming the 'storagename' is correct and the file path entailed an Excel file, the API response would indicate whether the file exists in the specified storage. To rectify the situation, please change the file path to target an Excel document with the appropriate extension in the desired storage. For instance, '/report.xlsx' if 'report.xlsx' is the file you are trying to check in 'storage'.

If the file does not exist in the specified location, the response would indicate that the file could not be found. This function is crucial for users who manage their Excel files in the cloud and need to verify the presence of their documents before performing further operations such as editing, data manipulation, conversion or rendering.

To proceed with the 'ObjectExists' API, please ensure that the path points to an Excel document with a supported extension. If '/report.docx' were an Excel file (assuming it has been given a wrong extension) and stored under 'default' storage, the API would check its existence and respond accordingly with confirmation if found or a message indicating its absence.
