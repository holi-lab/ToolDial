    "response": "The 'GetDiscUsage' API in Aspose.Cells Cloud allows users to retrieve the current disk usage details for their account. This information includes the total amount of space allocated to the user, the amount of space currently used, and the amount of free space remaining. It helps users monitor their storage consumption and manage their files accordingly. To make a call to this API, you would typically need to authenticate with your account credentials, and the API would return the storage statistics. Since the input parameters are not defined in your request, the exact JSON response structure cannot be provided. However, an example response might look like this: {\n    'totalSize': '100GB',\n    'usedSize': '35GB',\n    'freeSize': '65GB'\n}. The figures in the example are for illustrative purposes and would reflect the actual data from the user's account when the API is called."
