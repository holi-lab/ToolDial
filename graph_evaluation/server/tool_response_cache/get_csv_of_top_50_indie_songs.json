        "response": "Please note that without specific input parameters, such as the date or a specific metric for the song data, the server will provide the most recent Top 50 indie songs based on the last recorded daily stream increase. Below is an example of how the CSV data might be structured. However, since this is an API simulation and we cannot output actual CSV files, the response will be a JSON array representing what would be the rows of a CSV file. Each song entry includes the song's rank, title, artist, daily stream increase, and label number:\n\n[\n  {\n    'rank': 1,\n    'title': 'Lost in Time',\n    'artist': 'Echos of Nowhere',\n    'daily_streams_increase': 15000,\n    'label_number': 'IN4502'\n  },\n  {\n    'rank': 2,\n    'title': 'Moments',\n    'artist': 'Sarah & The Sundays',\n    'daily_streams_increase': 14000,\n    'label_number': 'IN4503'\n  },\n  // More entries here...\n  {\n    'rank': 50,\n    'title': 'Driftwood Heart',\n    'artist': 'Lonely Traveler',\n    'daily_streams_increase': 2000,\n    'label_number': 'IN4599'\n  }\n]\n\nThe actual CSV file generated by the API would include headers and rows for each song. In practice, this data can be used by industry professionals, such as radio station programmers, event organizers, and music analysts to track indie music trends, potential hits, and emerging artists."
