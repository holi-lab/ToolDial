        "response": "The 'Media sources statistics' API is designed to gather and provide detailed statistics or information concerning various media sources. Without specific input parameters, it's difficult to generate a direct response. Generally, this API helps users to find comprehensive analytics related to media sources such as websites, social media platforms, or any digital publication. This could include data on audience demographics, engagement rates, geographic distribution of viewership, content reach, and performance metrics over a given period. To make the most of this API, users are encouraged to provide specifics such as the name of the media source, time frame for the data required, and the type of statistics they are interested in (e.g., viewership count, engagement rate). This information would enable the API to fetch and return precise statistics tailored to the user's needs."
