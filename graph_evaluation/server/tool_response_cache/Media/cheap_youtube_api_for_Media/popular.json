Typically, a 'Popular' API function would return a list of trending or widely viewed videos on a specific platform, possibly filtered by various criteria such as category, region, or timeframe. The output would usually include details like video titles, descriptions, view counts, upload dates, and possibly links to the videos. For a tailored response, please provide more specific input parameters such as the desired category, region, or timeframe for the popular videos you're interested in."
