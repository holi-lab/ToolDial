This API specifically requires 'accountid', 'subaccountid', 'password', and 'umid' (unique message ID) to retrieve the delivery status of a sent message. The provided input appears to be for sending a new message rather than querying the status of an existing one, as it includes 'phone_number', 'message', and 'schedule_time' parameters, which are not applicable for the 'Get delivery status' API. To use the 'Get delivery status' API correctly, please ensure to provide the unique message ID ('umid') of the message you wish to track, along with your account identification details. This will enable you to receive real-time updates on the delivery status, such as whether the message has been sent, delivered, or failed, thereby offering valuable insights into the message's delivery process."
