        "response": "The Voice API, part of the Voice Gateway from Melrose Labs, does not directly use the 'country' parameter as input for its core functions of text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and inbound/outbound voice routing. Typically, such APIs would use input parameters related to the text or audio content that needs to be processed, or configuration for voice routing. If the 'country' parameter is meant to specify a regional preference for text-to-speech accents or for configuring regional voice routing rules, this should be explicitly stated in the API documentation. Without more specific details on how the 'country' input would alter or affect the API's behavior, it's challenging to provide a targeted response. Reviewing the API documentation or clarifying the intended use of the 'country' parameter would help in crafting a more precise answer."
