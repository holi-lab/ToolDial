    "response": "The 'ConvertTiffToFax' API function has successfully processed 'example.tiff' from the default folder. The TIFF file has now been converted into a CCITT (The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee) fax compatible format, which typically uses a Group 3 or Group 4 compression scheme optimized for efficient fax transmission. The output file is now suitable for fax machines, reducing file size while maintaining a readable level of text quality. You may download or further process the converted image as required for your fax communication purposes."
