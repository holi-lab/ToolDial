        "response": "The fuel rate API is designed to provide users with the latest fuel prices across different cities in India. This powerful tool grants access to updated information on fuel costs, allowing users, businesses, and researchers to make informed decisions based on current rates. However, due to the lack of specific input parameters, no city has been selected for fetching the fuel rate, and consequently, no fuel price data can be provided at this moment. To receive accurate fuel rate information, please provide the input parameter 'city_name' with the name of the city you are interested in. For instance, an appropriate request would include {'city_name': 'New Delhi'} to get the latest fuel rates in New Delhi. Once a 'city_name' parameter is provided, the API will respond with the current fuel price for the specified city, which may include prices of different types of fuel such as petrol, diesel, CNG, and LPG, if applicable."
