        "response": "Our Homeless Shelters by Location API has returned a list of registered homeless shelters within a 10-mile radius of the given coordinates (47.630703, -122.186370). The search encompasses shelters that provide temporary accommodation, essential amenities, and various support services to individuals and families who are homeless. Please note that the actual response would normally include specific details on each shelter, such as name, address, contact information, types of services provided, capacity, and any particular intake procedures or restrictions that may apply. However, due to the constraints of this scenario, we are unable to include actual shelter data. For complete information, users are encouraged to utilize the API with these parameters on the official platform, which will access the most current and comprehensive data available in our database."
