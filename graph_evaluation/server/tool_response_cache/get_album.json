    "response": "The API information provided is insufficient to generate a response. The 'tool_description' only gives a Telegram handle 't.me/shahzodbeeck' but does not describe the tool's capabilities or functions. There is an empty 'api_info' array which normally would provide the necessary details of the API's available end points, their function, and how to use them. Additionally, the 'API Examples' array is empty, meaning there are no reference points for forming a response or understanding the expected output format. The 'API Input' containing an 'is_id' suggests the API may involve some form of identification process, but without more context, it's impossible to deduce the purpose or intended output. More detailed documentation is required to fulfill the API call with a valid response."

  "{'is_id': 'Chicago'}": {
    "error": "",
    "response": "The input parameter received indicates that the API call is related to the 'is_id' value 'Chicago.' However, the documentation provided does not contain any 'api_info' that defines what the 'is_id' refers to or how it should be processed. In the usual context, an 'is_id' might be an identifier used to retrieve specific information from a database or service. Since 'Chicago' is a city name, the API might be expected to return data related to Chicago, such as demographic information, geographical data, current local time, weather conditions, or any other service that the tool is designed to provide. Unfortunately, without proper API documentation and a description of the tool's capabilities, it's not possible to generate a specific and accurate response that would reflect the intended output of the API. Additional details on the API's endpoints, parameters, and the expected response structure are necessary to process this request as intended. The mere Telegram handle 't.me/shahzodbeeck' provides no clarity on the functions or operations that the API performs. In a typical scenario, the 'is_id' of 'Chicago' might be used to query a database or an external service that recognizes this identifier as a valid input and can return the corresponding result tied specifically to this identifier."
