        "response": "The '/marks/men/' API endpoint within this specialized tool is designed to retrieve marks for men from the World Athletics Scoring Tables. These tables are used to convert performances in athletics events into a score. Scores allow for a comparison of results across different events, making it easier to gauge an athlete's overall performance or to compare performances across disciplines. The tables cover a wide range of events, including track and field competitions like sprints, middle and long-distance running, hurdles, jumps, and throws. When you make a request to the '/marks/men/' API, you will receive data according to the latest scoring tables provided by World Athletics. The data returned can include the point values associated with specific performance marks for various track and field events. For example, a returned dataset might show that certain times in the 100-meter dash equate to specific point scores, or particular distances in the shot put correspond to predefined points. These reference points serve as benchmarks for athletes to target in order to achieve a specific score in their events. It should be noted that the data will be specific to men's events and will take into account the scoring adjustments that are unique to those events. The API would be utilized by coaches, athletes, statisticians, and fans who are interested in understanding the point value associated with athletic performances for men."
