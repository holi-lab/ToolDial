        "response": "The API titled 'Metals Futures Prices,' referencing data from 'https://www.investing.com/commodities/metals,' is designed to retrieve current and historical prices of various metal commodities traded in futures markets. This API is beneficial for investors, financial analysts, and traders who require up-to-date information on metals like gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper among others. It can provide data points such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, percentage change, volume of trades, time of last trade, and historical trends. To ensure an effective response, an API request would typically include specific parameters such as the type of metal of interest, the time frame for price data (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), and other optional filters like the futures contract expiry date. However, since the API input provided is empty, specific data regarding metal futures prices cannot be delivered. For a complete response, please provide the necessary input parameters."
