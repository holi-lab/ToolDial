    "response": "The 'List Movies' API allows users to access a comprehensive database of movies. It is designed to provide functionality to list all available movies and also to search through the movie catalog using various parameters. Users can apply filters to narrow down the results based on their preferences such as genre, release year, director, actor, rating, etc. Sorting capabilities enable users to order the movie list according to different criteria like alphabetical order, release date, popularity, or user ratings. Additionally, users may search for specific movies using keywords that could match movie titles, descriptions, or cast members. With these features, the 'List Movies' API serves as a versatile tool for movie enthusiasts and professionals alike, offering a user-friendly interface and comprehensive search capabilities to efficiently navigate the extensive movie library. However, since no input parameters were provided, the default response would typically include a list of all available movies, possibly paginated, with no filters or specific ordering applied. For efficient API usage, it is recommended to provide relevant filters, search queries, and sorting options to obtain more refined results tailored to the user's needs."
