However, the input provided is 'report.docx', which is a Word document, and not an Excel file, so the API would not be able to process it as is. In order to use this API, you need to provide a file with an extension such as .xls, .xlsx, or other Excel-compatible formats. If 'report.docx' needs to be recognized or processed, please ensure it is in the correct format. If you are looking to convert 'report.docx' into an Excel format before recognition, you may need to use another API that supports DOCX to XLS/XLSX conversion first. Please provide a valid Excel document for the 'GetRecognizeDocument' API to return a proper response."

        "response": "The 'GetRecognizeDocument' API is designed to work on Excel files such as .xls or .xlsx formats, enabling the recognition and processing of document elements within these files. Since no specific parameters were provided in the API call, I would like to remind users that they must provide the 'name' parameter with the file path or file ID of the Excel document they wish to work with. Upon providing a valid Excel file, the API will perform recognition operations tailored to the spreadsheet content it contains. The recognized data could then be used for various purposes, such as automated data entry, analysis, or further manipulation of spreadsheet content. If you need to recognize elements from a non-Excel file, please ensure to convert it to an Excel-compatible format before calling this API. To proceed, please submit a valid API call with the correct input parameters."

        "response": "The 'GetRecognizeDocument' API within Aspose.Cells Cloud is specifically designed to handle recognition tasks for Excel documents. The API expects the name of the document to be in a format such as .xls or .xlsx to perform its operations correctly. The input provided, namely 'report.docx', signifies a Word document rather than an Excel file. Therefore, the API cannot process it for document recognition. To utilize this API, you must provide a valid Excel document. If your intention is to convert 'report.docx' into an Excel compatible format before performing recognition tasks, then you will need to use a separate conversion API that supports DOCX to XLS/XLSX conversion. After conversion, you can use this recognized Excel document with the 'GetRecognizeDocument' API to obtain the desired outcome. Additionally, the input contains a 'resulttype' parameter, but without further documentation on this parameter, it is unclear how this might affect the processing. Typically, the 'resulttype' could dictate the format of the recognized data output from the Excel file. If a conversion is required, please convert your document appropriately and resubmit the request with the correct Excel file format."
