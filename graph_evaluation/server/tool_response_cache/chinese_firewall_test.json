        "response": "The Chinese Firewall Test for the domain 'microsoft.com' did not indicate any signs of DNS poisoning from the tested locations within mainland China. Access to 'microsoft.com' appears to be possible from these points in the network, suggesting that the site is currently not blocked by the Great Firewall of China. However, please bear in mind that results can vary depending on the specific geographic location and testing server within China, as well as the potential for access restrictions to be applied or lifted at any given time. It's also important to consider that other blocking methods besides DNS poisoning could be in use and may impact accessibility. For comprehensive results, periodic testing is recommended, especially if managing a website that requires consistent availability to Chinese audiences."
