        "response": "The 'getUserByName' API function retrieves information about a user from the Pet Store database based on their username. Given the username 'john.doe', the API would return the user's profile including details such as user ID, name, email, and any associated orders or pets. If 'john.doe' is a registered user, the API will fetch and deliver this data. If the username does not exist in the database, the API would typically return a notification stating that the user could not be found. This functionality is crucial for managing user-related operations within the Pet Store system, such as updating user information, checking order history, or managing pets associated with the user."
