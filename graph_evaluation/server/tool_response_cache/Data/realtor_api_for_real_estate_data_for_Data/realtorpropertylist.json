        "response": "Unfortunately, without the context of the tool's description and specific API information, providing a detailed response to the input parameters 'offset', 'city', and 'state_code' is challenging. Normally, an API receiving such parameters could be related to querying a database for information about a specific location, possibly returning data about local businesses, weather forecasts, real estate listings, or community events in Pleasanton, CA. Since the 'offset' parameter is included, it could imply pagination in the results, suggesting that the user is looking to start from the beginning of a list. Without more context, this is speculative. For a precise and useful response, more details about the API's purpose are needed."
