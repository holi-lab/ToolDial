        "response": "This tool is designed for automating the process of forwarding tokens as soon as funds are received. It supports a variety of tokens including BNB, BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain, ETH, and ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. With this tool, users can set up a mechanism where incoming funds to a specified wallet address are immediately sent to another predefined wallet. This can be especially useful for merchants, traders, or platforms looking to automate their token flow, reduce manual handling, and increase efficiency in managing their digital assets. Additionally, this tool could enhance security by minimizing the amount of time tokens stay in a single wallet, potentially reducing exposure to theft or losses."
