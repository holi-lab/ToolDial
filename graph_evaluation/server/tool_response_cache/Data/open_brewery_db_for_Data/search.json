        "response": "To search for breweries using the Open Brewery DB API, please provide a query with relevant keywords. The API is designed to offer information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops, mainly in the United States. You can search based on location, amenities, or the name of a brewery. However, please be aware that without specific search parameters, we are unable to process a meaningful search request. For example, you can replace '{}' with a relevant query such as {'query': 'dog friendly breweries in Colorado'} or {'query': 'brewpubs near San Francisco'}. This will help narrow down your search to provide you with a list of places that match your criteria."
