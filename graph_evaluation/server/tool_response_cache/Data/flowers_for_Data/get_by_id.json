      "description": "This is an excellent choice for anyone looking for bright, beautiful blooms all through summer into fall. There are around 70 species of Osteospermum and an increasing number of cultivars, and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) lists about 900 varieties. One stem carries a single flower, comprising a central disc surrounded by bright petals. The petals of some species are variegated in color, offering the most stunning bloom. Most petals are flat, but some produce spoon-shaped petals, such as the Osteospermum Sunny Philip. Depending on what zone you live in, different species can be annuals or perennials."
