Nice house with many amenities!, fully stocked kitchen, great play room and a pool!  There are many steps and a lift would be helpful!  Please add some front motion lights&#x2014;it is difficult to see walkway in the dark.",

The house was clean and very nice upon our arrival, and described perfectly. Our only complaint is there are no outside lights other than around the stairs. We brought corn hold boards and would've liked to play them at night, but we couldn't see. Other than that no issues, we will definitely be back!",

          "We recently stayed at this vacation home with family. It was big enough for 6 adults and 4 children. The home is within walking distance to the beach and has a really nice pool. There are a lot of stairs in the home so I don\u2019t believe it would be ideal for elderly/disabled. It was very clean and we had no complaints.",

The pool and yard were so enjoyable and relaxing.  Super easy walk to The Gulf.  One of the air conditioners was not working when we arrived and Paradise Beach Homes had a crew out there minutes after we got in and fixed within 30 minutes.  I would definitely stay at this location again and recommend to others.",

From watching the fireworks to the Blue Angels we had an amazing view. The pool is much larger than the pictures show and very well maintained. Game room is fun however some items need replacing or fixed. It wouldn&#x2019;t prevent me from renting this house again. The house was always cool. Air conditioners worked well. Plenty of towels and all linens were clean. We really enjoyed this rental.",

          "We enjoyed our time at this rental for a family trip. Plenty of space and all was as advertised. The property was very clean and well maintained. Location was great. The property management company was prompt in responding to any issues/questions. \n\nWe would have preferred a modernized (digital) check in/out process but the company made it as quick as possible when in their office. Traffic, parking, etc. near the office adds about 30 minutes to both the check in and out process.\n\nThanks to the owner for keeping this in such great shape. We plan to book again for 2023!",
