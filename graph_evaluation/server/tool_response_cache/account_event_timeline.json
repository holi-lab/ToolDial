        "response": "The 'Account Event Timeline' API provides a chronological view of activities associated with users' accounts, based on the specified event type. Given the input parameters such as 'event_type' set to 'account_activity', 'client_id', and 'client_secret', the API would return a timeline of account-related events for the client associated with 'my_client_id'. This timeline may include user sign-ups, sign-ins, password changes, and other relevant user actions captured on the website or app. Each event in the timeline would typically contain the event time, user identifier, event type, and possibly additional metadata such as ip address or location data if available. The specific structure of the returned data could vary depending on the client configuration and the granularity of event tracking set up in DailyCred."

        "error": "",
        "response": "The 'Account Event Timeline' API responds with a detailed list of login events, providing an organized chronicle based on the event type specified, which is 'login' for this request. For the client specified by the 'client_id' parameter, the returned data would consist of a series of user authentication instances, laying out the timeframe at which these logins occurred. As a comprehensive record, each entry on the timeline would likely include the timestamp of the login, the unique identifier of the user, the event type to explicitly denote it as a login event, and potentially additional context such as the user's device or geographical information if such data collection is configured. This insight is crucial for the client to monitor user engagement, ensure security by identifying suspicious login patterns, and to better understand user behavior on the website or app."

        "response": "The 'Account Event Timeline' API, when provided with 'event_type' set to 'all', a 'client_id', 'client_secret', and a specific 'user_id', returns a comprehensive timeline of all account-related events for the user identified by the 'user_id' against the client associated with 'your_client_id'. This includes a full history of the user's interactions with the website or app, showcasing events like account creation, email verifications, logins, logouts, password updates, profile changes, and other significant user-driven events. The output is a collated record detailing the dates and times of these occurrences, along with any pertinent details about the user's actions. Additional information might contain location details, device types, IP addresses, or any custom event information tracked by the integration with DailyCred. This aggregated data empowers the client to analyze user behavior, track engagement levels, monitor for security issues such as unauthorized access attempts, and optimize the user experience based on this historical interaction data. The data structure returned by this call would be organized chronologically and may be filtered or segmented further based on additional parameters or client preferences as supported by DailyCred."

This chronological record focuses on tracking the email verification process, which is an essential part of account security and user authentication. Each entry in the timeline will capture the event where the user's email address was either verified successfully or an attempt was made. Critical details associated with these events typically include the timestamp of when the email verification took place, the status of the verification (successful, failed, pending), and any pertinent transaction identifiers or tokens that were generated as part of the verification procedure. The data might also highlight any repeated verification attempts or issues encountered during the process, providing insights into user behavior and potential security challenges faced during account setup or recovery processes. This information is key to understanding user account lifecycle events and can inform measures to streamline the verification experience or bolster security protocols."

        "response": "The 'Account Event Timeline' API, upon receiving an 'event_type' parameter set to 'logins_count', along with 'client_id' and 'client_secret', will generate a summary of login events for the specific client associated with 'your_client_id'. This summary is not a detailed timeline of individual login events but rather an aggregation that tallies the total number of logins that have occurred over a defined period. The response typically includes the total count as well as a breakdown by time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly counts), helping the client to understand the frequency of user logins and observe trends or patterns. Such data is instrumental for assessing the overall user engagement with the website or app and could additionally serve as a metric for the impact of marketing campaigns, feature releases, or other significant events on user activity. The aggregated data might also be used in cross-referencing with other analytics to ascertain correlations with user behaviors or outcomes."

With the 'client_id' specified as 'your_client_id', the API output would include details of each sign-up event, encapsulating data such as the exact timestamp for when each registration occurred, identifiers unique to the new users, the specific event labeled as 'registration', and additional details if configured such as the source of sign-up, or the marketing campaign that led to the user's conversion. This API's output helps maintain a comprehensive insight into user growth metrics and the effectiveness of user acquisition strategies."
