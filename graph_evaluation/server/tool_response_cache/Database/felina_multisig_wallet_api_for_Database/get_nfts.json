        "response": "The 'Get NFTs' API is designed to retrieve a list of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are currently owned by a particular wallet. To effectively utilize this API, the caller must provide relevant wallet details as input parameters (e.g., the wallet address). Once this information is provided, the API will access the underlying database that maintains records of NFT ownership. It will then compile a list of all NFTs associated with the specified wallet, including details such as the NFT's unique identifier, the name of the NFT, the collection it belongs to, and other pertinent attributes like rarity, creation date, and current market valuation. The output is structured to offer users a comprehensive overview of their NFT holdings, facilitating easier management and valuation of their digital assets. Without specific input parameters, such as a wallet address, the API cannot proceed to fetch the list of owned NFTs."
