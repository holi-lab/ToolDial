If you want to search for romantic movies from the 2000s, you would need to perform multiple API calls for each year in the decade specifying the correct 'genres' parameter with a value such as 'Romance'. After collecting the results, you can then combine them to create a comprehensive list of romantic movies released in the 2000s."

However, notable romantic movies from the year 2000 that might typically appear in such a list include 'Chocolat' directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, featuring actors like Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. The film intertwines romance with a charming story of a woman and her daughter opening a chocolate shop in a small French village that shakes up the rigid morality of the community. Another romantic highlight from 2000 could be 'In the Mood for Love' directed by Wong Kar-wai, with stars such as Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, renowned for its exquisite narrative style and visual aesthetics that encapsulate an unrequited love story in 1960s Hong Kong. Please note that the availability of these movies in our database can fluctuate due to changes in rankings and user ratings on IMDB."
