To make use of the 'Get English Alt Text' service, we would require specific details regarding the pet image you wish to receive alt text for. Typically, an input would include the type of pet, an image identifier, or preferences on the context of the alt text. Without these details, we are unable to provide you with a pet image and its corresponding English alt text. Please provide the necessary inputs as per the API documentation and try again."
