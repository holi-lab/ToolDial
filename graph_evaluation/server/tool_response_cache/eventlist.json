        "response": "The 'EventList' API within the 31Events calendaring event management service, as described in the tool documentation, is assumed to be an API call that returns a list of events possibly with details such as event titles, descriptions, times, dates, and participation status. Given that there is no additional input or description provided for this API, I would expect the output to be a list of upcoming events that a user or customers have been invited to, including metadata associated with each event such as unique identifiers, the event's status in the calendar (e.g., pending, accepted, declined), organizer info, and various attributes of the event (location, duration, etc.). The response may also contain filtering or pagination capabilities to handle a large number of events, although these are not described in the input. Since no specific examples or error cases are provided, the output provided here assumes a successful retrieval of an event list with no errors or specific filtering applied."
