        "error": "",
        "response": "We do not currently support the 'img' mode for the 'blender-project' API. This API is designed to execute Blender in headless mode (without a GUI), taking a ZIP file as an input. The ZIP file should contain a 'main.blend' file, which includes the 3D model, and a 'script.py' that contains the scripting commands for Blender. Once executed, this API typically produces a render of the 3D model or runs a Blender script that manipulates the 3D file. If you require an image thumbnail of a 3D file, you may need to update your input to provide a link to a ZIP file containing both 'main.blend' and 'script.py'. Your 'script.py' should include commands to render a thumbnail image from the 'main.blend' 3D model. If you need further assistance or have additional questions about using the API, please refer to the documentation link provided or contact our support team for more guidance."

        "response": "The 'blender-project' API has successfully received your request to execute Blender in headless mode with the provided ZIP file. The API is now processing the file located at '<ZIP_URL>'. This file is expected to be a ZIP archive containing a 'main.blend' file, which includes the necessary 3D model data, as well as a 'script.py' file that contains the Blender scripting commands for operation. The execution of this command in Blender will produce an output in accordance with the instructions specified within the 'script.py' file, such as rendering an image or manipulating the 3D model in some manner. Upon completion of the process, you will receive either the rendered file, if the script is set to produce a render, or the outcome of any other script-defined action. Please note that the resulting file can be quite large, approximately 20 MB, depending on the complexity of the render or actions performed by the script. If you encounter any issues or require assistance, please consult the example at the provided documentation link or reach out to our support team for further help."
