        "response": "The holder structure for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is composed of diverse shareholder groups. As of the most recent reporting period, institutional investors hold a significant portion of AAPL's shares, reflecting confidence from large financial organizations in Apple's long-term growth prospects. These may include mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Insider holders, referring to Apple's executives, board members, and employees with access to non-public information, also maintain a stake in the company which aligns their interests with the shareholders at large. Additionally, the general public, comprising retail investors, owns a share of AAPL as well, further diversifying the company's holder structure. The exact percentages and number of holders fluctuate over time with market trades and reporting updates. Typically, a detailed report might break this down into percentages of ownership, the top institutions and their respective holding values, and changes in the holding structure over the recent quarters. Bear in mind that holder information is subject to change and should be verified for the most current data."
