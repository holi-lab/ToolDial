    "response": "The 'cities' API provides a comprehensive list of cities where Flixbus operates. The list includes major urban centers, towns, and sometimes rural locales that serve as stops or destinations for Flixbus services. Each city in the list is typically accompanied by details such as city name, Flixbus city ID, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and sometimes additional information such as available facilities at bus stops or stations, recommended points of interest, and a brief description of the city's significance in the Flixbus network. For example, you might receive a list that includes cities like Berlin, Munich, and Paris, along with their respective Flixbus city IDs and coordinates. Flixbus continually updates this list to reflect new routes and changes in service areas."
