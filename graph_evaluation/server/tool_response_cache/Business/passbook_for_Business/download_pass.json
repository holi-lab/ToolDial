The 'passtypeidentifier' you provided, 'pass.example.id1', is a unique identifier for the pass template, while 'serialnumber' '27f145d2-5713-4a8d-af64-b269f95ade3b' uniquely identifies the pass itself. By combining these, PassSlot can locate the exact pass intended for download. Once located, the service generates a pass file (.pkpass) that can be opened in wallet applications supporting Passbook standards, facilitating easy access to passes such as tickets, coupons, or membership cards without physical copies. Remember, successful download depends on the validity of both identifiers provided."
