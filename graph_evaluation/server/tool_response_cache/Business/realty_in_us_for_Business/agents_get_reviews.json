She was on the top of everything, from the search to the showings to the paperwork  to the last minute of the closing process.\nI will always thank Maria Stella for all the Guide, Support, Professionalism, Advices and Patience with my search and purchase! \n",

        "comment": "Maria-Stella is truly the best of the best! A friend recommended her services to me and I emailed her right after. She was immediately responsive and we began working together on budgets, locations, and potential purchases. She is incredibly understanding and listens to her clients. She pays attention to detail and gave us many options to choose from before we visited final listings. \n\nMaria-Stella is very punctual and arrived early or on-time to every listing. She observed and analyzed each listing with us, like she was purchasing it for herself. She even went above and beyond to look under rugs to make sure the flooring was not damaged!\n\nShe is easily accessible and communicates well with her clients. She responded to my emails within the hour and to my texts! But besides Maria-Stella\u2019s professionalism, one of her best qualities is her kindness. She truly wants you to find the right home! She spent a lot of time listening to our concerns, asking questions, making sure we were taking the right steps, especially as first time home owners. Now that we\u2019ve closed on our first home, I can truly say that Maria-Stella has transitioned from our broker, to our friend. It was an absolute pleasure to work with her and get to know her. We feel blessed to have worked with such an incredible broker who made us feel like family and helped us find our home. You\u2019re the best Maria-Stella! ",
