    "response": "The API you are referring to, 'GetFileVersions', is likely designed to retrieve the different versions of a given file stored in a cloud service. However, based on the input provided which is 'report.docx', it seems there might be a misunderstanding or incorrect input, given that the tool description references Aspose.Cells Cloud API which is specialized in handling Excel documents (.xls, .xlsx, etc.), and not Word documents (.docx). Assuming the correct file path should indeed point to an Excel file, the API may return a list of the available versions of that Excel document. The response would include version-specific details such as the file version identifier, last modified date, size, and other relevant metadata. If the correct file path was provided, the JSON response to a successful API call for retrieving file versions of an Excel file from the path 'report.xlsx', for example, might look something like this: { 'file_versions': [ { 'version_id': 'v1', 'last_modified': '2023-01-15T12:34:56Z', 'size': 1024 }, { 'version_id': 'v2', 'last_modified': '2023-01-20T08:21:33Z', 'size': 1042 } ] }"
