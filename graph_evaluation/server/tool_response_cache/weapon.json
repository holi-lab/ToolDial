      "description": "The Vandal is a fully automatic rifle that is a popular choice among players who prefer consistent damage output and accuracy. It's effective at both medium and long-range combat. Its high damage per shot to the head ensures that if a player is precise, they can eliminate an opponent with a single bullet up to 50 meters away. The Vandal is often compared to its counterpart, the Phantom, due to its contrasting features, such as having no damage drop-off at a distance and a louder firing sound."
