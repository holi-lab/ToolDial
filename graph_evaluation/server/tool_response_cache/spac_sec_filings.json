        "response": "To provide a response for the SPAC SEC Filings API without specific input, we can consider giving a general overview of the type of information that users can expect from this API. As the API is designed to retrieve the latest SEC filings filtered by SPAC symbol, it would typically output relevant documents such as Forms S-1, 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q. These filings would contain official communications and reports submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), offering insights into their financial performance, potential merger or acquisition targets, regulatory compliance, and other corporate matters. The response could include data on the date of filing, type of document, filing party, and a link to the full text of the SEC filing on the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, the API would likely allow users to filter results based on specific SPAC symbols to get targeted information relevant to particular companies of interest. Since the API Input is empty, an example of output is not provided, but with the correct SPAC symbol input, the response would feature structured data including the aforementioned details about the latest filings from that SPAC."
