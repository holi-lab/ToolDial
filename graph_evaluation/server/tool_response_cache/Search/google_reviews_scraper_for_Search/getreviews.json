He came by the week I called, took measurements, and had the job done by the next week.  The shower is just what I wanted. He was always courteous and knows plumbing.

        "response": "The API call specifies 'sort' as 'pagination', which is not a recognized sort method within the API documentation. The API is primarily designed to retrieve reviews of businesses by sorting them by ratings, newest, latest, or date in descending order. The provided ID appears to be encrypted, suggesting it may be used to uniquely identify a business for which reviews are being requested. With an empty 'nextpage' parameter, the call seemingly aims to fetch the first page of reviews. Given the incorrect 'sort' parameter, a suggested fix would be to use a valid sort method such as 'rating', 'newest', 'latest', or 'date_desc' to properly retrieve and sort the business reviews as per the request."

Currently, there are no additional pages of reviews to display ('nextpage' is empty), indicating that all relevant reviews have been compiled in this request. Keep in mind, for privacy and security, the actual business identity is concealed through encryption ('is_id'). To access more detailed reviews or if you are looking for reviews under different sorting criteria (e.g., newest, latest, date_desc), consider adjusting the 'sort' parameter in your next API call. This ensures you receive the most tailored and comprehensive review data for any business or company searched on Google."
