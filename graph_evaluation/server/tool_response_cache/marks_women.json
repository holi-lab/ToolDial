        "response": "The World Athletics scoring tables are a standardized system used to compare performances across different athletics events. They are often used in multi-event competitions such as the heptathlon for women and decathlon for men, and can also be referenced to understand how a single performance matches up in terms of international standards.\n\nSince the API input provided does not specify a particular event or score, I will give a general overview of how the marks for women's events are determined and what their significance might be.\n\nIn women's track and field, the scoring tables assign points to the performance marks achieved in various events such as 100 meters, long jump, shot put, heptathlon, etc. Each event has a table where performance times or distances correspond to a point value. For instance, running 100 meters in 11.5 seconds might score 985 points, while throwing shot put to a distance of 18 meters could be worth 1096 points.\n\nThe points allow for fair comparison across different events and help in ranking athletes according to their performance levels. In multi-event competitions, an athlete's points from all events are totaled to determine the overall score and ranking.\n\nThe tables are periodically updated to reflect changes in performance standards. Coaches, athletes, and sports enthusiasts often use these tables to set benchmarks and goals for training and competition.\n\nFor accurate and event-specific point calculations, the API requires additional input parameters such as the name of the event and the performance mark. Once provided, the API can return the exact points that correspond to the performance mark for that particular women's athletics event according to the latest scoring tables published by World Athletics."
