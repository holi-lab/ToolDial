        "response": "The 'Story by URL' API is designed to retrieve an Instagram story based on the URL you provided. The API processes the URL 'https://instagram.com/stories/story1' and accesses the data associated with that specific Instagram story. The information retrieved typically includes the media content of the story (which can be an image or video), the text and stickers used, the posting date and time, and the profile information of the user who uploaded the story. It ensures that you get real-time data if the story is currently active or the last available data if the story has expired (as Instagram stories are available for only 24 hours). Please note, the API's ability to fetch this data may be subject to Instagram's privacy settings and API usage policies. If the story is from a private account or has been deleted, the API might not be able to retrieve it."

        "response": "The 'Story by URL' API requires a specific Instagram story URL as input. Without a URL, the API cannot proceed to retrieve any information. Please provide a valid Instagram story URL to get details about the story, such as the media content (image or video), text and stickers, posting date and time, and the uploader's profile info. Make sure that the account is not private, and the story is within the 24-hour active window to ensure the API can access the required data."

        "response": "The 'Story by URL' API successfully processed the input URL 'https://instagram.com/stories/story1'. Upon retrieval, the API has gathered comprehensive data relating to the specific Instagram story. The collected information encompasses the visual elements of the story, which includes either an image or a video file, along with any textual content, emojis, or stickers that have been incorporated into the story by the user. The metadata associated with this story, such as the timestamp indicating when the story was originally posted, is also included. Additionally, the API provides details regarding the user's profile who has uploaded the story, including their username and profile picture. This wealth of information provides a snapshot of the story, as it appeared within the 24-hour window of its posting on Instagram. It is important to note that the effectiveness of the data retrieval is contingent upon the accessibility of the story, which in turn is governed by the user's privacy settings and Instagram's terms of service. Should the story be sourced from a private account or if it has already been removed from the platform, the API may encounter limitations in accessing the desired data."

        "response": "The 'Story by URL' API has successfully retrieved information for the provided Instagram story URL 'https://instagram.com/stories/story2'. The data includes the media content, which may consist of images or videos, depending on the original upload. Additional elements such as any text overlays, stickers, or other interactive features used in the story have also been collected. Additionally, the API returned metadata such as the posting timestamp to indicate when the story was made live on the account. The user's profile that posted the story, including their username and potentially their profile picture, is part of the response data. It is important to note that this information is subject to the availability of the story at the time of the request. If the story has surpassed the 24-hour visibility window or is from an account with privacy restrictions, the API may not retrieve complete data. In such cases, an appropriate error message will be provided or the data will reflect the limitations in access due to privacy settings."
