The fuel prices are typically reported in the local currency of each country and may also be available in Euros for a standardized comparison. This API is an invaluable tool for individuals and businesses alike, ensuring access to the latest fuel cost trends within the European market. To use this API, simply make a request without any input parameters, and it will return a list of countries accompanied by their respective fuel prices.
