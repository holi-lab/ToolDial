        "response": "The 'getAll' API within the 'Reword PDF' tool is designed to extract all the text content from a specific PDF file. Based on the input provided, with the 'pdfid' being '123456', this API would process the PDF file associated with this unique identifier, extract the text contained within it, and return the full text content as the response. The operation would likely involve reading through the PDF file's pages, extracting the text layer by layer, and consolidating this information into a coherent, readable format that can be utilized for further editing or processing. The output would not include images or any non-text elements. This text extraction is the first step before any additional operations, such as text replacement or editing, can be performed. Note that the 'getAll' API's primary function is to retrieve text, hence the response will focus on the textual content of the PDF identified by 'pdfid' '123456'."

        "response": "The 'getAll' API within the 'Reword PDF' tool has successfully processed the PDF with the identifier '123456789'. All textual content has been extracted from the document's pages. This comprehensive extraction included reading each page thoroughly and transferring the text from the PDF into a usable string format. The result is a complete representation of the document's text content, which can now be manipulated for tasks such as searching, text analysis, or further editing. Subsequent actions may involve replacing specific strings of text or altering the content for different purposes. It is important to note that the extracted text does not include graphical elements or images, as the API specifically targets text layers. The returned text is now ready for any text-based operations that the user may need to perform on it. As privacy is important, this information is handled securely in accordance with data handling standards applicable to this tool."

        "response": "The 'getAll' API of the 'Reword PDF' tool has been executed for the PDF with the identifier '123'. The procedure involved scanning the specific PDF document to extract all the textual content present across its pages. During this process, each page was read in sequence, with an emphasis on accurately capturing the text. The extracted content is then formatted into a string which represents the full scope of text contained within the document, while ignoring any non-textual elements such as images and graphics. The output, which is now in a format suitable for text manipulation, allows for various subsequent operations including but not limited to searching within the text, conducting text analysis, or performing edits and replacements of specific text segments. Since the process targets only the text layers, users wishing to work with graphical content will need to utilize different functionalities or tools. This API ensures that the text extraction prioritizes readability and coherence, setting the stage for whatever text-related tasks the user intends to pursue afterwards. Furthermore, all operations adhere to best practices in data security and privacy."
