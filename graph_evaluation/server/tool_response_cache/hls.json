An HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) URL typically points to a playlist that contains the media segments for the video. Once you supply the HLS URL, the API will process the conversion and provide you with a downloadable MP4 file, which will be compatible with various devices and players. The output MP4 file will retain the video quality and content of the original stream as closely as possible. Ensure that the provided HLS URL is valid and accessible for the conversion to proceed successfully."
