    "response": "This API provides a comprehensive list of all the countries that SHEIN supports on its platform. It provides not only the country names but also unique identifiers and country codes which are essential for other endpoints and services to function accurately. The data structures the countries into different categories: hot countries and item categories, where 'hot countries' might pertain to the regions with the most traffic or sales, and 'item categories' likely represent a general list. The countries are represented with their respective 'id', which is a unique identifier for database reference, 'countrynum', which can be a dialing code or another numeric representation unique to the country, and 'value', the internationally recognized two-letter country code. Additionally, there's the full 'country' name for each record, which can be used for display purposes. For instance, the returned list includes the United States with an id of '226' and a value of 'US', which can be classified as a hot country. The list goes on to include various other countries such as Andorra (AD), Angola (AO), and Australia (AU), reflecting the global reach of SHEIN's services. This endpoint is crucial for ensuring that services can be tailored and offered correctly according to the user's location."
