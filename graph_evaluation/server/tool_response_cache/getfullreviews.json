He came by the week I called, took measurements, and had the job done by the next week.  The shower is just what I wanted. He was always courteous and knows plumbing.

When I needed an adjustment almost a year later within that warranty period they answered the phone promptly and came back within a few days as agreed.  They made the additional adjustments to my satisfaction with no additional charges.

After dealing with a few other plumbers, I've been extremely happy with the level of service and affordable prices that David provides. He is always very responsive to my requests and my tenants are very pleased with his results. It can be difficult to find a trustworthy and experienced plumber in Raleigh. David is the man I trust for all of my plumbing needs. I've been so impressed with his work that I've referred David to multiple friends and colleagues. In my line of work, it's hard to find people who ACTUALLY do what they say they are going to do. David is one of those people. I can confidently say he'll do right by you, no matter what.",

David and Jim came out the same day I called... as our HWH was a goner, and needed replacement . It is in the attic, pull-down stairs, and in 87 + degree heat. Not only was the unit replaced , Dave improved the way the pipes were originally laid out and other little extras, and left the place clean!    He went above and beyond and he charged an amazing price !..for all that hard work and all this at the last minute at the end of the day!  AND not only that but he guarantees his labor for ONE YEAR! Who does that? THAT is HONEST Hard work and  as you know, is very rare these days. This is our plumber from now on ! DO it! call them...You will be glad you did.

They charged me an emergency after-hours fee (after being late) After assessing the situation, they made a series of demonstrably false statements (I have photographic evidence to counter them all) to suggest the purchase of more expensive services, including that: 1.  My water pressure was 110PSI (my gauge later read 97PSI) 2. I do not have a water-pressure reducing valve installed on my house (I do - it may not be working properly, but it is clearly visible from the area the plumber was working in) 3. The supply line from the meter to the house is made of PB and likely to burst (it is made of PEX, transitioning to PB in the house. This is also clearly visible from where the plumber was working) I would recommend getting a second opinion before committing to any services this enterprise recommends..

He looked at the pipes for the dishwasher and told me he hates to install dishwashers. He didn t want to do it. He offered me the name of a handyman located several towns away. He said he was going to have to tell the assistant to stop giving him dishwasher install jobs. I asked if they had another plumber on staff to do it. He said  I m the only one . He asked what other plumbing I needed. Of course I said no. I will be calling another provider. I do not recommend this company.",
