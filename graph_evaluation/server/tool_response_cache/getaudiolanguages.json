        "response": "The getAudioLanguages API provides a list of all audio languages available for TED talks. This API allows users to filter TED talk content based on the preferred audio language. TED talks are often translated and dubbed into various languages to cater to a global audience. Accessing this API will give users the ability to see the comprehensive set of languages into which TED talks have been translated. This information can be particularly useful for non-English speaking users or those looking to improve their language skills by listening to talks in a foreign language. The response typically includes widely spoken international languages such as Spanish, French, Mandarin, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, German, along with less commonly spoken languages, reflecting the diversity of the TED talks audience. Knowing the available audio languages can enhance the user experience by allowing for personalization based on linguistic preference."
