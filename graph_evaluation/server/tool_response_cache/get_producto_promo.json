        "response": "The 'Get Producto Promo' API within this tool is designed to retrieve promotional information related to products. Although the description 'Adsa' is not very descriptive or clear, based on the API's name, the expected output would likely include details on current promotions, discount rates, promotional periods, and any terms and conditions that may apply. The typical use case for this API is to provide customers with information about special offers or deals that are relevant to their purchasing decisions. Since there are no specific input parameters provided, we can assume that the API, when called without parameters, would return a list of all active promotions across various product categories or an overview message indicating that there are no active promotions at the moment. Please note that actual content output would require further details on products and promotional campaigns the business is running."
