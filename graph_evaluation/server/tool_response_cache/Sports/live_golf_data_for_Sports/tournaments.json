        "response": "The API call for 'tournaments' requires a 'tournid' and 'year' parameter to fetch detailed information about a specific tournament. Since the 'tournid' parameter is missing in the provided input, the request cannot be processed as intended. Typically, this API would return data including metadata about the tournament, such as its name, location, and dates, along with information about the players participating, the courses being played, and the prize money distribution. To make a successful request, please ensure to include a valid 'tournid' that corresponds to a specific tournament you are interested in. This information can usually be obtained by first querying the 'schedule' endpoint with the 'orgid' and 'year' parameters to get a list of tournaments for the specified year. Once you have the 'tournid', you can then request detailed information about that tournament."
