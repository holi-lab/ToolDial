        "response": "The friends_attending API endpoint retrieves a list of friends from the user's social network on Dudu.com that are attending a specified event. Given the event_id 12345, the API will return a collection of user profiles who have RSVP'd or shown interest in attending this event. The profiles typically include information such as the user's name, profile picture, and any public note regarding their attendance. The data returned enables users to see at a glance which of their friends they can expect to meet at the event. Furthermore, this information can help facilitate networking and coordination for event activities among friends. Note that to access this data, a valid application_id is required for authentication with the API. The application_id 'sKx4R6Pt' will be used for this purpose. If no friends are attending or the event_id does not exist, the response would indicate an empty list or an error message, respectively. However, with proper credentials and a valid event, the user can seamlessly interact with their multilingual social network without language restrictions, thanks to Dudu.com's unique translation technology."

        "response": "The 'list' API endpoint on Dudu.com is responsible for retrieving lists of users based on specific criteria. In this particular API call, the parameters specified instruct the system to fetch a list of users that have a 'friend' relationship status with the requesting user and are tied to the application with the id '123456'. The response of this API will include an array of user profiles that match the friendship criteria. Each profile in the list might contain the user's name, profile image, language preferences, and any additional information related to their status on the social network platform. Utilizing Dudu.com's unique translation technology, the list could potentially display information in multiple languages, catering to an international audience without language barriers. This list is of great use in social contexts where an application might need to display a user's network or enable features based on a user's friends on the platform. In the event no friends match the criteria or the application_id is not valid, you would typically receive either an empty list or an error message explaining the reason for the absence of data."

        "response": "The list.friends API endpoint is designed to provide a user-centric list of friends related to a specific context or event within the Dudu.com social network. In this case, the API is being called with parameters indicating a 'user' type filter and specifying the relation to be 'friend' for a particular 'event_id' named 'event123'. The user making the request has an 'app_id' of '123456', which acts as a unique identifier and, presumably, is an important factor for authentication and authorization purposes. Upon successful execution of this API call, the expected output would be a structured list containing the user profiles of friends who are, in one way or another, associated with the specified event. The list would likely present each friend's essential details such as name, profile picture, and possibly their intentions or status regarding the event (e.g., 'attending', 'interested', or 'invited'). This information plays a crucial part in enhancing the user's social experience on Dudu.com by providing an insight into the social dynamics of their network, particularly around collaborative activities like events. Moreover, with the platform's inherent translation technology, the returned information would bridge language gaps among friends who speak different languages, allowing for a seamless and inclusive user interaction."

        "response": "The 'list' API endpoint on Dudu.com is designed to provide users with a detailed enumeration of entities based on specific criteria defined in the request parameters. In this particular case, the parameters indicate a request for a list of 'event' entities where the relationship is 'attendee'. By processing these parameters, the API will generate a list of events along with the attendees associated with each event within the user's social network. The response will contain essential information such as the event titles, dates, locations, and a sublist of attendees with their names and possible profile pictures. Additionally, any relevant notes or statuses that attendees might have shared regarding their participation in the events will be included. The application_id '123456' provided serves as the authentication key ensuring that the request is authorized and the data integrity is maintained according to the user's privacy settings and the network's data-sharing policies. Upon a successful query, the user will receive a rich response enabling them to explore which events are popular among their friends, aiding in social planning and engagement on the multilingual Dudu.com platform."

The list would typically include critical details such as the friend's name, profile picture, and any pertinent information such as their location, interests, or any custom status messages. When a user makes this API call, they can expect to receive an array containing the profile information of each individual who is connected with them on the multilingual social network.

The data is crucial for users looking to maintain social interactions and grow their network within the platform. To ensure privacy and security, the API requires authentication with a valid application_id, which in this case would replace 'YYYYYYYY'. Without a valid application_id, the API will not return any data. Given the parameters, the response should include data structured in a JSON array with each friend's details formatted as individual JSON objects within the array."
