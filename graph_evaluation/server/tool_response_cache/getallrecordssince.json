        "response": "Function: GetAllRecordsSince - This API call retrieves all the data records that have been modified since the given Unix timestamp (1630563124). This includes any updates to CRM records, proposals, budgets, case/time management, time tracking, invoicing, marketing activities, newsletters, and other relevant modifications within the 360 Business Tool system. The data is fetched based on the last modified date, ensuring that any records that have changed since that timestamp are included in the output. The function is designed to provide an efficient synchronization mechanism for external systems that need to keep up-to-date with changes in the 360 Business Tool. It is particularly useful for maintaining consistency across integrated systems such as financial accounting platforms, calendars, emails, inventory, payroll systems, banks, and more."
