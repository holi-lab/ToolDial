        "response": "To use the 'Media sources statistics' API effectively, it is important to provide specific input parameters that will guide the search and retrieval of details or statistics on media sources. Unfortunately, the API Input is currently empty. To proceed, you should supply input parameters such as 'source_name', 'date_range', 'media_type', or 'keywords' which would allow the API to understand what information you are seeking and to provide accurate statistics and details. An example of a meaningful request could be asking for the number of times a particular media source was cited within a certain date range, or requesting viewership statistics for a certain type of media within a specified period. Once appropriate inputs are provided, this API will respond with comprehensive statistics such as total mentions, reach, demographics, engagement metrics, and trend data related to the media sources in question."
