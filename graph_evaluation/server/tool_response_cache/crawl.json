This document would contain all essential elements of a search results page, including but not limited to:\n\n- DOCTYPE declaration to define the document type and version.\n- HTML tags that enclose the content of the entire document.\n- HEAD tag which contains meta-information about the document such as meta tags with charset, viewport settings, title of the results page, and links to external files like CSS stylesheets.\n- BODY tag encompassing search result items, including organic results with titles, URLs, and snippets; sponsored results; related questions and possible answer boxes; knowledge panels where applicable; image or video thumbnails for queries that trigger these results; and news article listings for timely or trending topics.\n\nAdditionally, there would be navigation aids like pagination controls, allowing users to move between different pages of results, and accessible features adhering to web standards to ensure a seamless user experience regardless of the device or browser being used.\n\nEach result would be structured in a way that highlights the core information sought by users, providing a clear hierarchy and legible formatting which prioritizes the relevance and authority of the content. For advanced queries or those with specific modifiers, the document would reflect these nuances in the arrangement and presentation of the search results.\n\nThe actual response from the functioning API can be used by developers, SEO specialists, or researchers who need to analyze search engine results for various purposes such as market analysis, academic research, or SEO strategy development."
