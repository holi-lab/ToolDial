Please note that the actual data retrieval would be based on real-time YouTube statistics and trends which are subject to change frequently. Here is an example response that such an API might generate: \n\nThe response lists the top trending YouTube videos, including both music and non-music content, with details such as video title, channel name, number of views, upload date, and a brief description. For example, the number 1 trending video might be a new music video from a popular artist, followed by a viral comedy sketch, and perhaps a news clip on a current global event. This can also include educational content, DIYs, tech reviews, gaming highlights, and more. The actual response will be dynamic and should be accompanied by links to the videos and possibly thumbnail images for a quick preview."
