        "response": "The Kompas-detail API you've called is designed to retrieve detailed information about news articles from Kompas, one of Indonesia's leading news websites. With the 'guid' parameter you've provided, which represents the unique identifier for the news article, the API would typically fetch and return detailed content including the title, author, publish date, and full article text, as well as any accompanying images or videos for the specific article corresponding to the 'guid' value 1612364.\n\nThe returned data structure would include fields such as 'title', 'author', 'publish_date', 'content', 'images', and 'videos' where available. These details provide a comprehensive view of the article and enable developers to integrate this content into applications or services for news aggregation, analysis, or personal use.\n\nPlease note that due to copyright restrictions, the content is delivered only for the purpose of this API interaction and should not be republished without proper rights and permissions from Kompas. Also, since the actual content is not retrievable by the API server, assume the content structure and practice 'fair use' by limiting the amount of verbatim copied text when presenting it in your services."

    "{'guid': 'banjir'}": {
        "error": "",
        "response": "The 'kompas-detail' API has processed your request with the 'guid' parameter value 'banjir'. The API is designed to retrieve and provide detailed information about news articles from Kompas, a prominent Indonesian news outlet. However, 'banjir' appears to be a keyword rather than a unique identifier, which typically would consist of numerical values. If you intended to use 'banjir' as a search term, you may need to use a different API that supports keyword searches to find articles related to flooding.\n\nIf 'banjir' is indeed the correct 'guid' for an article, the API would return structured information including 'title', 'author', 'publish_date', 'content', and multimedia elements like 'images' and 'videos' associated with the article. This data serves to give a thorough understanding of the selected article, useful for content aggregation, research or informational purposes. We would like to remind you to ensure the usage complies with copyright restrictions, and you have the necessary rights for any republishing.\n\nIn this specific case, without a valid numerical 'guid', we are unable to provide the detailed article content. To proceed, please submit a proper numerical 'guid' or consider using a search-based API with the term 'banjir' to find related articles on flooding or similar topics."

        "error": "",
        "response": "To use the Kompas-detail API effectively, you are required to provide a specific 'guid' parameter which is a unique identifier associated with a news article on Kompas. This parameter is essential as it allows the API to return detailed information for that particular news piece. Without the 'guid' value in your request, the API cannot proceed to fetch any information.\n\nOnce a valid 'guid' is included in the API call, the Kompas-detail API will access Kompas's extensive database to retrieve essential elements such as the article's title, author, publication date, and full narrative, along with any images or videos that are part of the article. This provides an in-depth look at the news article, facilitating its use in various applications such as content curation, media monitoring, or research.\n\nPlease resubmit your request with a proper 'guid' to get the requested data. For any further assistance or guidance on how to use this API, please refer to the API documentation or reach out to support."

    "{'guid': '12345'}": {
        "error": "",
        "response": "Upon receiving the 'guid' with a value of '12345', the kompas-detail API would initiate a query to extract detailed information associated with that specific news article from the Kompas database. Given this unique identifier, you can expect to receive a comprehensive data packet that includes the article's headline, the name of the journalist or author, the date and time the article was published, the full body of the text, and any embedded media such as photos or videos.\n\nWhile the actual content is to be used in compliance with the copyright policies of Kompas, the structured information provided could be highly beneficial for numerous applications. These might range from building news aggregation platforms that curate content from various sources, to serving as a resource for researchers conducting media analysis, or even for individuals seeking in-depth perspectives on events covered by Indonesian media.\n\nPlease note that the actual payload from the API call would consist of a JSON object with fields corresponding to 'title', 'author', 'publish_date', 'content', 'images', and 'videos'. This would enable the seamless integration of the data into a variety of software applications or online services, thereby extending the reach and influence of news reported by Kompas to a broader audience. The utility of this data is particularly pronounced in a digital era where access to timely and reliable news sources can significantly impact public understanding of current events."
