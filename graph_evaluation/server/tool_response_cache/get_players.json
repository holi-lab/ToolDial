        "response": "The GET_players API is designed to retrieve a list of video player configurations available in your account on api.video. On invoking this API without any specific query parameters, it returns an array of players that you have previously set up, with details such as the player ID, various configuration settings like autoplay, loop, control bar visibility, etc. For each player, you may also receive additional data such as the theme color, font, and any custom branding or overlays you may have added. Moreover, it may include links to more details on each player where you can check analytics, customizations made, or events tracked for the particular player. The API responds with the information in JSON format, which can be easily integrated or parsed within your application to display or manage your video player settings. It is important to have a valid API Key and the necessary permissions to access this data. If an unauthorized request is made, or if an error occurs, the API will return a detailed error message explaining the cause of the failure."
