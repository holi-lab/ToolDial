The team managing the passive strategy earns the strategy an Average People Pillar rating. The strategy's parent organization is industry standard, albeit with some strong attributes like overall reasonable fees, but is held back by high portfolio manager turnover. This earns the firm an Average Parent Pillar rating."

Historical data, such as Morningstar's Active/Passive Barometer, shows that passively managed funds have generally outperformed their active counterparts, especially over longer time horizons.

Typically, a lower yield comes with the benefit of less credit risk. The portfolio has a higher average surveyed credit quality of BB, compared with the typical peers' B. Strategies with less credit risk may help to provide a reliable ballast during periods of market stress. In terms of interest-rate risk, compared with others in the High Yield Bond category, this fund maintains a significantly elevated average effective duration of 5.1 years compared to the category's 3.4 years. The longer a strategy's duration, the more sensitive it is to shifts in interest rates. This fund, with a 5.1-year duration, is expected to gain 5.1% of its net asset value if interest rates drop by 1 percentage point, and vice versa.",
