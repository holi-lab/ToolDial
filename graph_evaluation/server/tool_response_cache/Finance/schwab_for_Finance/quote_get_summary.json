            "Teaser": "Ongoing price cuts and U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) again offset the broader economic headwinds in Q2, including higher interest rates and sticky inflation, fueling Tesla's (TSLA +7%) record deliveries in the quarter and energizing the stock. Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles in Q2, nicely ahead of street estimates and a 10.5% improvement from the previous quarter, which was also a record. \n Tesla's delivery report may also not be the sole factor sending its shares higher today. Several other EV manufacturers, including Rivian (RIVN), XPeng (XPEV), NIO (NIO), and Li Auto (LI), each registered solid delivery figures in Q2 and June, a broader reflection of underlying health within the EV industry. The upbeat reports are also lifting other non-pure EV OEMs, such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Volkswagen (VWAGY). Tesla divides its deliveries into Model S/X (higher-priced models) and Model 3/Y (lower-priced models). Its lower-priced Model 3/Y group exhibited notable strength, with deliveries up a whopping 87.4% yr/yr and 8.4% sequentially. The yr/yr growth showcased the pent-up demand following a lengthy chip shortage that hindered production last year.  Meanwhile, Model S/X deliveries were the inverse, climbing 19.0% yr/yr and 79.8% sequentially. The massive leap from Q1 is due to January price cuts, which were most significant across the Model S and X lineup, not taking effect until March. Additional reductions in April also saw Tesla's higher-tier lineup receive larger discounts than the Model 3 and Y. However, even though the slashed prices helped power higher deliveries, it likely came at the further expense of margins. Last quarter, this worry partly contributed to a notable sell-off. Tesla also did see margin erosion during Q1, with total gross margins contracting by 977 bps yr/yr and 450 bps sequentially to 19.3%, well shy of analyst expectations.  Furthermore, a disparity between production (479,700) and deliveries (466,140) remained relatively wide in Q2. When production continues to exceed deliveries, it signals rising inventories, a reflection of potential demand weakness. However, the discrepancy continued to narrow over the past three quarters on an absolute and percentage basis. Additionally, management remarked last quarter that the production/delivery difference resulted from the company moving to a more-regional balanced mix of build and deliveries.\n  Tesla's recent price cuts to qualify its vehicle lineup for the new U.S. tax credits have sparked a significant rally in deliveries over the past two quarters. Unlike after its Q1 report, investors applaud Tesla's numbers from Q2, a reflection of dissipating worries that China-based competitors are stealing market share and macroeconomic conditions are eroding demand. \n Although margins will likely undergo another quarter of contraction in Q2 (scheduled for July 19), Tesla's actions have spurred considerable demand. They may also accelerate its long-term goal of reaching 20 mln in annual deliveries. With Tesla's charging technology quickly becoming the U.S. standard following deals with Ford and GM and its long-awaited Cybertruck slated for launch this year, the company is showing no signs of letting off the throttle despite its shares already surging over 140% YTD.
