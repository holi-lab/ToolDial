        "response": "The Company Quarterly Cash Flow API provides an up-to-date financial assessment of a company's cash flow on a quarterly basis. For the symbol 'GOOGL', this API would typically present the cash flow statement, divided into three main parts: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The operating activities section shows the cash generated from the company's core business operations. Investing activities represent cash involved in the acquisition and disposal of long-term investments and assets. Financing activities detail cash movement between the company and its investors, including dividends, issuance of stocks, and debt repayment. Note that without the format parameter being specified, the default response may cover the most recent quarterly data available. However, due to the constraints in this scenario, specific financial figures cannot be provided."
