        "response": "The 'v5/schools' endpoint of the Aeries API is designed to retrieve information about schools that utilize the Aeries system. When you send a request to this endpoint, it is expected to provide a list of all the schools, possibly including details such as the school ID, name, address, contact information, and other relevant data. The information can be used by educational institutions, software integrators, and third-party service providers to manage and analyze educational data, or integrate with other systems that require detailed school information. The 'v5/schools' API is part of the broader Aeries API system, which is web-based and follows RESTful principles, ensuring that interactions are performed using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. To call this endpoint successfully, certain parameters such as an API key or access token might be required for authentication purposes, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information. Additionally, there may be options to filter or search the data returned by the school name, district, or other criteria."
